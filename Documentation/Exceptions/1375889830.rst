TYPO3 Exception 1375889830

You are not allowed to access files outside your storages
=========================================================

This exception is thrown in FAL whenever you are trying to access a file
outside of your configured storages. The default storage is fileadmin
(see
https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ApiOverview/Fal/Index.html).

In backend modules this exception will occur if files in legacy
folders/storages are accessed, which is prohibited due to security
reasons (see https://review.typo3.org/#/c/23608/).

Solution
--------

Either try to access files in a valid storage instead (like
:file:`fileadmin/_temp_/` instead of (:file:`uploads/not/working`) or add the
desired folder to a storage configuration.
