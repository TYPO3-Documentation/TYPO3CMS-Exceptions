   Exception text
   --------------

   503

   Flex form displayCond on field "<FieldName>" on flex form sheet "<SheetName>" references
   a field or field / sheet combination "<otherFieldName>" that might be defined in given
   data structure but is not found in data values.

   The Issue
   ---------

   If the exception occurs in the backend when a non-admin editor tries to insert a new
   content element or plugin, then probably this is a matter of permissions: a field that
   the user has access to references another field to which the user has no access.
   Most likely in a 'displayCond'.

   Solution
   --------

   Check the access rights for this user, in the usergroups the user belongs to. Find the
   section 'Allowed excludefields [non_exclude_fields]' and look for the flexform belonging
   to this content element or plugin. Then make sure to either check, or uncheck all fields
   that reference each other.
