> #1486155150: The RecordLinkHandler expects identifier and uid as
$parameter configuration.

Happens during upgrade to TYPO3 version 8.

Possible Reason:

The Linkparser cant handle links to extension records, like

::

   <link record:tt_news:1 - internal-link>News Record</link>

Solution: Search for records in database and change the link manually,
then run the migration wizard again.
