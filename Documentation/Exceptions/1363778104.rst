**If you inject a service, or whatever other class in a model:**

Please be sure you implement the Singleton interface in the service.

Example:

I have a Domain Model under \\Custom\Domain\Model.php, in which I do:

::

   /**
   * myService # optional property name as this is not really a property, it does not make much sense to name it
   *
   * @var \Custom\Services\MyService
   * @inject
   * @lazy
   */

protected $myService;

Then I need to make sure MyService class is declared like this :

::

   class MyService extends \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Controller\ActionController implements \TYPO3\CMS\Core\SingletonInterface
