TYPO3 Exception 1363778104
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

There is no `@var` annotation for property "..." in class "..."
===============================================================

Before TYPO3 v10
-----------------

**If you inject a service, or whatever other class in a model:**

Please be sure you implement the Singleton interface in the service.

Example:

I have a Domain Model under \\Custom\Domain\Model.php, in which I do:

.. code-block:: php

   /**
   * myService # optional property name as this is not really a property, it does not make much sense to name it
   *
   * @var \Custom\Services\MyService
   * @inject
   * @lazy
   */

   protected $myService;

Then I need to make sure `MyService` class is declared like this:

::

   class MyService extends \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Controller\ActionController implements \TYPO3\CMS\Core\SingletonInterface
