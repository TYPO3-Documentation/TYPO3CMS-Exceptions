==========================

..  warning::
    #1690365240 RuntimeException
    The rendering context of ViewHelper f:link.action is missing a valid request object.

Installation Overview
---------------------

`<f:link.action>` Viewhelper in Standalone View (Email)

The Issue
---------

The error comes when trying to send an email.

Solution
--------

I solved this by setting standaloneView->setRequest, however this method is internal.

..  code-block:: php

    use TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\RequestInterface;

    public function sendEmail(RequestInterface $request, ...): bool
    {
        $this->standaloneView->setRequest($request);
        // Set sender to default value
    }

Using the internal method `setRequest()` on the `StandaloneView` is currently the best option. 

Another solution would be provide the fully build links as variable assignments to the view.
