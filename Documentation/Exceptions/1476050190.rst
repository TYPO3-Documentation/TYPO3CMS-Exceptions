TYPO3 13.4.4 - 25.01.2025
=========================

When trying to view the Content Security Policy backend module throws error if EXT:lowlevel is not installed.

..  error:: 
    (1/1) #1476050190 TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Routing\Exception\RouteNotFoundException
    Unable to generate a URL for the named route "system_config" because this route was not found.

Can be solved by installing :composer:`typo3/cms-lowlevel`.


On accesssing the admin tool from the backend
=============================================

Access the the install tool directly(via typo3/install.php) and clear
all caches.

This helped in TYPO3 9.5.
