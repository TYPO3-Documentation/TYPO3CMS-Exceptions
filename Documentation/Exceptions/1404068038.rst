TYPO3 Exception 1404068038
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

No extension key could be determined when calling `addPlugin()`
===============================================================

You will see this exception most likely because
`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addPlugin()` is used
in a :file:`ext_tables.php` file, which will not work. As described in the API
`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addPlugin()` is
meant to be called from :file:`ext_tables.php` or (as of TYPO3 6.2.4 or later) in a file
in :file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php`. Calling it from any other
place e.g. :file:`ext_localconf.php` does not work and is not supported

If you call it from :file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php`, the
extension key needs to be specified as third parameter.
