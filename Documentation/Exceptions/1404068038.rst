TYPO3 Exception 1404068038
==========================

You will see this exception most likely because
t3lib_extMgm::addPlugin() or
\\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addPlugin() is used
in a ext_tables.php file, which will not work. As described in the API
\\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addPlugin() is
meant to be called from ext_tables.php or (as of TYPO3 6.2.4) in a file
in Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php. Calling it from any other
place e.g. ext_localconf.php does not work and is not supported

If you call it from Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php, the
extension key needs to be specified as third parameter.
