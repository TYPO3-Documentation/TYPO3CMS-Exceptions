TYPO3 Exception 1313855173

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


First of all: Please check, if you have configured your controller in
ext_localconf.php

If the problem still comes up:

#. Have a look at
   `this <http://www.typo3forum.net/forum/extbase/59994-action-show-list-not-allowed-plugin.html#post192668>`__
   [not available anymore], if you work with
   switchableControllerActions.
#. Maybe you have changed your content element from another plugin to
   your new extbase plugin. In that case it may be that the previous
   plugin works with FlexForms (pi_flexform). Extbase will read these
   FlexForm-Configurations regardless, if your plugin needs them or not.
   So please delete current content element, create a new one and choose
   your plugin OR clear content of col pi_flexform in database of this
   content element.
#. If you don't want to add the missing controller to ext_localconf.php
   you have the posibility to add following into your TypoScript:

plugin.your_extension.mvc.callDefaultActionIfActionCantBeResolved = 1

see [ERROR: Cannot get content for issue "31322"]

Another possibility is that you may have the same plugin twice on the
same page with different switchable controller actions chosen. If there
is one switchable controller action chosen on another plugin that does
not allow this controller, you'll have to adapt your page setup or your
switchable controller actions.
