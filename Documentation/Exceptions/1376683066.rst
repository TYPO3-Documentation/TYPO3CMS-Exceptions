   Uncaught TYPO3 Exception #1376683066: The slot method JambageCom\TtProducts\Slots\DatabaseRecordListSlots->addValuesToCsvRow() returned a different number (2) of arguments, than it received (1). (More information)

| 
| This happens if a signal slot method is used to extend an extension or
  TYPO3.

   TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\SignalSlot\Exception\InvalidSlotReturnException thrown in file
    /var/www/html/typo3_src-7.6.16/typo3/sysext/extbase/Classes/SignalSlot/Dispatcher.php in line 147.
    17 TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\SignalSlot\Dispatcher::dispatch("JambageCom\DbList\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList", "beforeSetCsvRow", array)

The signal is called with a paramter *array($csvRow)*:

::

   $this->signalSlotDispatcher->dispatch(__CLASS__, 'beforeSetCsvRow', array($csvRow));

However the according slot method returns only *$csvRow*

::

   class DatabaseRecordListSlots
   {
     public function addValuesToCsvRow($csvRow)
     {
       $csvRow['neu'] = 128;
       return $csvRow;
     }
   }

The slot must return the same array of arguments as the dispatcher
signal has used before.

::

   class DatabaseRecordListSlots
   {
     public function addValuesToCsvRow($csvRow)
     {
       $csvRow['neu'] = 128;
       return array($csvRow);
     }
   }
