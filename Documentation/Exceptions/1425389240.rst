===========================================

Affected: 9.5.x and maybe earlier versions

If this errors occures for the TYPO3 backend and/or install tool,
check the file PackageStates.php, the extension "backend" might be missing. 

Affected: 7.4.0 and 7.5.0-dev and maybe earlier versions.

See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704

Limitation: When I delete all pages in the page tree, and then try to
right-click-"New" => I hit the error again. Basically this means that
this workaround only works as long as you don't delete all pages.

The issue https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704 has been fixed and the
corresponding version released, updating to the latest 7.5 version might fix the problem.
