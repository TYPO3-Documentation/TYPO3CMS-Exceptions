TYPO3 Exception 1425389240
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Affected: 7.4.0 and 7.5.0-dev and maybe earlier versions.

See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704 [not available anymore]

Workaround for 7.5.0-dev 8f540ffbf880691a17d6d4c3ca4f184abba84d22:

-  Export (to .t3d) a single leaf page from another TYPO3 CMS instance
   (mine was 6.2)
-  Right click root element in page tree => Import from .t3d (I imported
   only page properties)
-  Now I can append other pages to that page by using the "New"
   operation (which failed before)
-  I can even add pages (with "New" to the root element which did not
   work before.
-  Still, none of my pages is tagged as "Use as Root Page" in page
   properties/"Behaviour" => It does not have to do with "Root Page".
   Instead, at least one page must exist to get rid of the Bug (as a
   workaround).

Limitation: When I delete all pages in the page tree, and then try to
right-click-"New" => I hit the error again. Basically this means that
this workaround only works as long as you don't delete all pages.

As soon as https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704 [not available anymore]
is fixed and the corresponding version released, an update might fix the
problem.
