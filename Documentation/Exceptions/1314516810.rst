File "..." does not exist.
===========================

In general: the mentioned file or folder does not exist, check if the file or
folder is available and has the correct file permissions.

Introduction Package
--------------------

A logo file is missing when the introduction is installed.

Workaround 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A workaround is to edit the TypoScript template on the root page and
comment the first line :typoscript:`//page.logo.file = fileadmin/introduction/images/theme/IntroductionPackage.png`

Workaround 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another solution is to go to the web root of your TYPO3 installation
(e.g. :file:`/home/typo3/www/` or :file:`/home/typo3/htdocs/`) and execute the following
shell commands which will copy the missing file to where it is supposed
to be:

.. code-block::

   mkdir fileadmin/introduction/images/theme/

   cp typo3conf/ext/introduction/Initialisation/Files/images/theme/IntroductionPackage.png fileadmin/introduction/images/theme/
