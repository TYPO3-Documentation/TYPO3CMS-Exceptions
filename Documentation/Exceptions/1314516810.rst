TYPO3 Exception 1314516810
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Problem
=======

A logo file is missing when the introduction is installed.

Method 1
--------

A workaround is to edit the typoscript template on the root page and
comment the first line //page.logo.file =
fileadmin/introduction/images/theme/IntroductionPackage.png

Method 2
--------

Another solution is to go to the web root of your TYPO3 installation
(e.g. /home/typo3/www/ or /home/typo3/htdocs/) and execute the following
shell commands which will copy the missing file to where it is supposed
to be:

mkdir fileadmin/introduction/images/theme/

cp
typo3conf/ext/introduction/Initialisation/Files/images/theme/IntroductionPackage.png
fileadmin/introduction/images/theme/

If you see this Exception because of an other reason
----------------------------------------------------

If you upgrade from older Version to 6.2.x, and click on -> Info Icon of
an Image that is related to a page/content element and got this
exception? `see FIX Problems with
sys_file_storage <typo3-exception-1319455097>`__

What also links to this exception: File /tmpl/layouts/ [myedit: or any other path/filename including \*uppercase\* letters /myedit] does not exist.
