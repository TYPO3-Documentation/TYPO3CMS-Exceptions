The default controller can not be determined. Please check for
Tx_Extbase_Utility_Extension::configurePlugin() in your
ext_localconf.php

Basic requirements
==================

This basically means that you need to define a controller in your
ext_localconf.php. Usually the first entry is taken as default
controller/action. Here's an example:

.. container::

   `PHP
   Script <https://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Help:Contents#Syntax-Highlighting_for_PHP-Code>`__
   [deprecated wiki link]

.. container::

   ::

      \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin(
        //assuming your extension is in typo3conf/ext/your_ext folder
        'YourVendor.YourExt',
        
        // Plugin name
        'Pi1',
        
        // An array of controller-action combinations. The first one found is the default one.
        array(
          'YourController' => 'index,new,create,edit,update'
        ),
          
        // An array of non-cachable controller-action-combinations (they must already be enabled)
        array(                
          'YourController' => 'new,create,edit,update'
        )
      );

Situation: Adding your plugin via TypoScript
============================================

This error can appear if you got your TypoScript wrong. Make sure that
you write your settings with the first letter in uppercase and
double-check your ext_localconf.

   TypoScript <https://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Help:Contents#Syntax-Highlighting_for_TypoScript>`__

      lib.test = USER_INT
      lib.test {
        # Calling the extbase bootstrapper 
        userFunc = TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Core\Bootstrap->run
        
        # Upcase!
        extensionName = YourExt
        vendorName = YourVendor

        # As you set it in \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin
        pluginName = Pi1
        #if you want to call action different than the default controller action add these lines:
        switchableControllerActions {
              YourController {
                1 = new
              }
        }
      }

Situation: Adding the Plugin via Flexform Plugin
================================================

Extbase has the possibility to override internal configuration from
Flexforms. This error might appear if you change a plugin from diffrent
types.

Try deleting the plugin instance and add a new, or clear
tt_content.pi_flexform field for current plugin, to avoid wrong
switchableControllerActions from flexform.
