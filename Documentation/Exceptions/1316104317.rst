::

    #1316104317 TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Exception 
    The default controller for extension "..." and plugin "..." can not be determined.`

If this happens for your own extensions:
========================================

Basic requirements
------------------

This basically means that you need to define a controller in your
:file:`ext_localconf.php`. Usually the first entry is taken as default
controller/action. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: php

   \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin(
     //assuming your extension is in typo3conf/ext/your_ext folder
     'YourExt',

     // Plugin name
     'Pi1',

     // An array of controller-action combinations. The first one found is the default one.
     [
       \YourVendor\YourExt\Controller\YourController::class => 'index,new,create,edit,update'
     ],

     // An array of non-cacheable controller-action-combinations (they must already be enabled)
     [
       \YourVendor\YourExt\Controller\YourController::class => 'new,create,edit,update'
     ],
   );

Situation: Adding your plugin via TypoScript
--------------------------------------------

This error can appear if you got your TypoScript wrong. Make sure that
you write your settings with the first letter in uppercase and
double-check your :file:`ext_localconf.php`.

.. code-block:: typoscript

      lib.test = USER_INT
      lib.test {
        # Calling the extbase bootstrapper
        userFunc = TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Core\Bootstrap->run

        # Upper camel case!
        extensionName = YourExt
        vendorName = YourVendor

        # As you set it in \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin
        pluginName = Pi1
      }

Situation: Adding the Plugin via FlexForm Plugin
-------------------------------------------------

Extbase has the possibility to override internal configuration from
FlexForms. This error might appear if you change a plugin from different
types.

Try deleting the plugin instance and add a new one, or clear
:sql:`tt_content.pi_flexform` field for current plugin, to avoid wrong
switchableControllerActions from FlexForm.

If this still isn't resolved, or happens for 3rd party extensions:
=========================================
If you got this error for e.g. `EXT:news` which probably shouldn't be badly configured, it can
be a broken routing configuration. So check your site yaml (includes) for

.. code-block:: yaml

    routeEnhancers:
      News:
        type: Extbase
        extension: News

And replace the lines following that with a default solution from the docs.
