TYPO3 13.4 - 2025-04-23
=======================

Installation overview
---------------------

A content element has a relation to a custom record which itself has a relation to one image.
When now using the record-transformation data processor and reference `{data.record.image}` in a `<f:image>` tag,
the following exception is thrown:

..  code-block:: plaintext

    Unable to render image uri in "tt_content:140": Supplied file must be File or 
    FileReference, TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Collection\LazyFileReferenceCollection given.

The issue
---------

TYPO3 provides a collection by default which cannot be resolved by the ImageViewHelper.

Solution
--------

Add `'relationship' => 'oneToOne'` (or one of the other values if appropriate) to the config section 
in the TCA configuration of the according field.
See: `relationship <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tca:confval-category-relationship>`__
