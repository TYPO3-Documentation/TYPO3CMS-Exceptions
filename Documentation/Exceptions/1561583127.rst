TYPO3 10.4.28 - 2020-05-25
==========================

Exception message:

 InvalidArgumentException: TypoScriptFrontendController must be constructed with a valid SiteLanguage object or a resolved site in the current request as fallback. None given.

Situation
---------

The `Preview` section of a flux content element used `<f:cObject>` to access a TypoScript-defined function. Because no TSFE is available in the backend, one is created and that brings this error


Solution
--------

Workaround: Do not use `<f:cObject>` in backend previews.

In TYPO3v11 this has been fixed with https://forge.typo3.org/issues/91511, but that change has not been backported to v10.
