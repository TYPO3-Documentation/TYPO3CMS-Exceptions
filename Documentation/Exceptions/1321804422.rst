TYPO3 Exception 1321804422
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


I encounter this error as soon as there is a htaccess that requires
login data, like this:

AuthUserFile /www/path/to/folder/.htpasswd AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName 'Bitte Zugangsdaten eingeben' AuthType Basic require valid-user

As soon as the login data was entered (correctly), this error appears:
Could not open log file "/www/path/to/folder/typo3temp/logs/typo3.log"

At the moment I have no solution - sorry...

--------------

Deleting the file helps in my case
