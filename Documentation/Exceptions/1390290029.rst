   Uncaught TYPO3 Exception
    #1390290029: You are trying to use a method on an inaccessible folder.

TYPO3 7:

-  accessed files/folders may be missing (check if the do exist)
-  filestorage may be out of webroot (try to move the files into a valid
   filestorage)
-  check the same folder in the backend module »file->list« - maybe some
   Icons will show you that the folder is not accessible
-  check missing folders in typo3temp
-  If the filestorage is readonly (Flag »Is writable« not set), the you
   may need to set a “Folder for manipulated and temporary images etc.“
   → This folder may be located in another filestorage, which is
   writeable (eg the non-writable filestorage is number 2, a writeable
   storage is number 1, then set this folder value to »1:/_processed_«)

processed directory readonly
============================

We had this error when listing files in the backend. The source of the
problem was that the folder contained image files and the backend wanted
to create and save preview images. The processed-Folder was set to a
second file storage whose root directory was readonly. After fixing that
permission problem of the second file storage, everything worked again.
