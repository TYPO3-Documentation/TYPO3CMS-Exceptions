TYPO3 Exception 1390290029

You are trying to use a method on an inaccessible folder.
=========================================================

Processed directory readonly
----------------------------

We had this error when listing files in the backend. The source of the
problem was that the folder contained image files and the backend wanted
to create and save preview images. The :file:`processed` folder was set to a
second file storage whose root directory was `readonly`. After fixing that
permission problem of the second file storage, everything worked again.

TYPO3 11.5 - File storage is offline / not found
-------------------------------------------------

Got to the backend module :guilabel:`File > Filelist` and check if a file
storage is offline. If so right click on it and choose :guilabel:`Edit` from
the context menu. Check the paths or sources that are configured here.

TYPO3 7
-------

-  accessed files/folders may be missing (check if the do exist)
-  file storage may be out of webroot (try to move the files into a valid
   file storage)
-  check the same folder in the backend module :guilabel:`File->List` - maybe some
   Icons will show you that the folder is not accessible
-  check missing folders in typo3temp
-  If the file storage is readonly (Flag :guilabel:`Is writable` not set), then you
   may need to set a :guilabel:`Folder for manipulated and temporary images`
   -> This folder may be located in another file storage, which is
   writeable (eg the non-writable file storage is number 2, a writeable
   storage is number 1, then set this folder value to :file:`1:/_processed_`)
