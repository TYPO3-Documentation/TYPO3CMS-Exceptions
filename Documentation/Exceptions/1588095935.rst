I got the error message

::

   #1588095935 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Http\Security\MissingReferrerException
   Missing referrer for /main

when I logged in into the backend or install tool after updating from
TYPO3 9.5.16 to 9.5.20. The error was caused by the feature
"security.backend.enforceReferrer" which was introduced in 9.5.17(?) and
is enabled by default. I edited my LocalConfiguration.php by hand and
inserted

::

   'SYS' => [
           'features' => [
               'security.backend.enforceReferrer' => false,
           ],
   ]
