    #1588095935 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Http\Security\MissingReferrerException
    Missing referrer for /main

This error occurs when logging into the backend or install tool and is
triggered by a failed check of a referer header.

The reason for this is the usage of an HTTP proxy,
for example a reverse proxy to an encapsulated system without
sufficient header delegation.
