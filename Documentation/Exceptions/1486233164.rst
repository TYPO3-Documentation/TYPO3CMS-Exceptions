This error can happen, when a record, containing a :ref:`FAL <t3coreapi:fal>`
relation, is about to be translated into another language. Possible reasons:

1.  The FAL data was created before any languages were created. In that case
    just delete the original FAL data and recreate it.
2.  The TCA is missing an "appearance" configuration, for example:

..  code-block:: php

    [
        'config' => [
            // ...
            'appearance' => [
                'showPossibleLocalizationRecords' => true,
                'showRemovedLocalizationRecords' => true,
                'showAllLocalizationLink' => true,
                'showSynchronizationLink' => true,
                'enabledControls' => [
                    'info' => false,
                ]
            ]
    ]
