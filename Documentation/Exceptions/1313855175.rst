To solve this, you can set the following in TypoScript:

::

   config.tx_extbase {
       mvc {
           callDefaultActionIfActionCantBeResolved = 1
       }
   }

or

::

   plugin.tx_yourextension.mvc.callDefaultActionIfActionCantBeResolved = 1

| 
| or you can solve at in ext_localconf.php

::

   Tx_Extbase_Utility_Extension::configurePlugin(
       $_EXTKEY,
       'yourExtensionEky',
       array(
           'yourController' => 'yourAction',
       ),
       // non-cacheable actions
       array(
           
       )
   );

or as of extbase 4.7 you need to update your FlexForm with all necessary
actions (semicolon separated) in case you use
switchableControllerActions:

::

            <switchableControllerActions>
              <TCEforms>
                <label>LLL:EXT:kofomi/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_be.xml:flexforms_general.mode</label>
                <onChange>reload</onChange>
                <config>
                  <type>select</type>
                  <items>
                    <numIndex index="0">
                      <numIndex index="0">LLL:EXT:kofomi/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_be.xml:flexforms_general.mode.eventgroups</numIndex>
                      <numIndex index="1">Events->list;Events->show</numIndex>
                    </numIndex>
                    <numIndex index="1">
                      <numIndex index="0">LLL:EXT:kofomi/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_be.xml:flexforms_general.mode.persons</numIndex>
                      <numIndex index="1">Persons->list;Persons->show</numIndex>
                    </numIndex>
                  </items>
                </config>
              </TCEforms>
            </switchableControllerActions>

or

if you happened to try Flexform with switchableControllerAction

this overwrites your ext_localconf.php even if you delete the Flexform
and the link in your ext_tables.php. The only possibility I have fount
to work with your extension again is - edit (with MySQLAdmin) the table
tt_content and search for switchableControllerAction in the column
pi_flexform. - delete the content of this field and everything works
fine again without Flexform.

| 
| Another issue that can occur is an issue with realurl configuration.
  It may pass action params as Capital case e.g. 'Show' instead of
  'show'. Either fix the realurl configuration or allow actions in
  uppercase.

Also, as developer if you changed the flexform above, remember to change
the plugin configuration on the referencing page as well. The page
configuration overrides the plugin configuration and will still have the
old (now invalid) value stored.
