.. note::
   If you encountered this exception, please help others by providing
   information about how you got this error. Especially if you have a solution,
   please add it to this page by following the :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" workflow

It happened by TYPO3 6.1.7 Fluid Extbase Flux Bootstrap Template

Oops, an error occurred!

Arguments useShortcutData, useShortcutTarget and useShortcutUid are
mutually exclusive. Please use only one at a time.

---

With the latest version of VHS, useShortcutUid is set to true by default
so, if you also set useShortcutData or useShortcutTarget to true, you
will have this exception.

A solution - while the bug is still present - is to set
useShortcutUid=false in your fluid template to invalidate the default
value.

If you have fluidpages 2.1.1 and vhs 1.8.5 installed than switch back to
Versions 2.1.0 / 1.8.4 and it is working again.

In Versions 2.1.1 / 1.8.5 "Various fixes, mainly small bugs. " have been
fixed and probably a bigger one has been created.
