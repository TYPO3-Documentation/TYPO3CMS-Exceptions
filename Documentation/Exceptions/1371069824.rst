TYPO3 Exception 1371069824
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


It happened by TYPO3 6.1.7 Fluid Extbase Flux Bootstrap Template

Oops, an error occurred!

Arguments useShortcutData, useShortcutTarget and useShortcutUid are
mutually exclusive. Please use only one at a time.

---

With the latest version of VHS, useShortcutUid is set to true by default
so, if you also set useShortcutData or useShortcutTarget to true, you
will have this exception.

A solution - while the bug is still present - is to set
useShortcutUid=false in your fluid template to invalidate the default
value.

If you have fluidpages 2.1.1 and vhs 1.8.5 installed than switch back to
Versions 2.1.0 / 1.8.4 and it is working again.

In Versions 2.1.1 / 1.8.5 "Various fixes, mainly small bugs. " have been
fixed and probably a bigger one has been created.
