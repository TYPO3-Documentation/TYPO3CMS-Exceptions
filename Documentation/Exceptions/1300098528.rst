.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Observed in TYPO3 6.2.0: This error occurs when importing a previously
exported page containing a reference to a file in fileadmin (Testing
6.2.0, after beta5, excat version
8cbb774ce1518b88e4e23646d9ac49f96ab1bd85)

Observed in TYPO3 6.1.7: This error showed up when an image was added to
a text with image content element (too many images? this was the 34th).
Error blocks editing of page in List/Page module in backend. To fix, use
History/Undo using the clickmenu in the pagetree to roll back to a
previous version before the image was added.

Observed in TYPO3 7.6 & 8.7: This error occur, when TCA media field
configuration is missing *--palette--;;filePalette* entry in *showitem*,
which is required. This often happens, if you manipulate *showitem*
configuration, to hide sys_file_reference fields for medias. See snippet
2017-3 Custom FAL inline overlay palette in BE for an example.
