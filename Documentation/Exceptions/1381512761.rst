Hello Core Team,

I get an error by using the extension cal (cal 1.9.3 / TYPO3 6.2.15).
Copy some calendardata with the clipboard generates an Error-Page with
the message: Invalid value 17 for TYPO3\CMS\Core\Versioning\VersionState

I can't find any solution for this. Can you help.

Thanks al lot

Hoge

| **Typo3 6.26**:

Error occurred in an extension after migration 6.1 -> 6.2 due to wrong
(invalid) field datatypes in the TCA ('type' => 'date',) -> 'date' is an
invalid type. It seems, v6.1 didn't care very much about invalid types,
but 6.2 does. Changing the datatype to 'type' => 'input', 'eval' =>
'datetime' solved the problem.
