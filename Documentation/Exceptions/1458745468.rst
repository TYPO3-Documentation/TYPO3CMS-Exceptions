The Issue
---------

 (1/1) #1458745468 UnexpectedValueException

 Invalid flex form data structure on field name "pi_flexform" with element "image" in section container "objectFeedback": Nesting inline elements in flex form sections is not allowed.

This exception occurs when nesting a `<flux:field.inline.fal>` inside a `<flux:form.section>`.
This is not supported anymore since TYPO3 v10.

See https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/issues/1803#issuecomment-697283924

Solution
--------
Rework the content element: Split it into a container element and a sub element that may be added multiple times.
