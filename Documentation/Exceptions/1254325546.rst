TYPO3 Exception 1254325546
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Occurence in Frontend
=====================

The page is shown without the common template but just with brown
background and the typical TYPO3 Error-Message: "Oops an Error accured"
This happens even without realUrl. After deactivating a contentelement
with powermail the page worked again, but the desired powermail-form was
surly missing.

Occurence in Backend
====================

Going in the Powermail-Module (Web -> Mails) and choosing Function-Check
I got the brown background with another Error-Message shown:

Cookie was not set since HTTPS was forced in
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][cookieSecure].

Steps without Success
=====================

-  Changing the version of Powermail is NOT fixing the Errors.
-  Uninstalling or deactivating realUrl is NOT fixing the Errors.

Fixing the Errors and Misbehavior
=================================

In the Admin-Tool set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][cookieSecure]=2 or
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][cookieSecure]=0
