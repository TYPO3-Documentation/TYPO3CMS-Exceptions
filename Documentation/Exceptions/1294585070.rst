Password change in "Admin Tools"->Reports
=========================================

The BE-Page "Admin Tools"->Reports offers a link to change the default
backend-user (admin, password) if still existent. After saving the
user-account it seems that the previous page should be loaded, instead
this error is shown:

Uncaught TYPO3 Exception

1294585070: No module "tools_txreportsM1" could be found.

UnexpectedValueException thrown in file /.../typo3/mod.php in line 55.

Clicking on the link "Admin Tools"->Reports links to the page without
errors and shows the page correct again.

openid
======

openid extension has an "Add OpenID" wizard (shown when editing a
backend user information) that triggers this error in TYPO3 6.2.27 No
idea how to prevent / fix this.
