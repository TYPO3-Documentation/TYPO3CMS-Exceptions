InvalidPasswordHashException: No implementation found that handles given hash
=============================================================================

The following exception may bubble up since TYPO3 v9 during login:

::

      #1533818591 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Crypto\PasswordHashing\InvalidPasswordHashException
      No implementation found that handles given hash. This happens if the
      stored hash uses a mechanism not supported by current server.

Explanation
===========

A frontend user, a backend user or the install tool password hash is
stored using a mechanism not supported by the current server. The login
process can not compare the given password with the stored hash.

Reasons
=======

This typically happens if a TYPO3 upgrade is performed on a system that
supports the default hash mechanism *argon2i*, passwords in the database
and/or the install tool password is updated to use this hash, and the
system is then deployed to a system that does not support *argon2i*.

Solutions
=========

Please see :ref:`Password hashing troubleshooting <t3coreapi:password-hashing\_troubleshooting>`.
