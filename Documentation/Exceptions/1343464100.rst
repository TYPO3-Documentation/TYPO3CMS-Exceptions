Error message
=============

Broken rootline. Mountpoint parameter does not match the actual
rootline. mount_pid (xxx) does not match page uid (yyy).

Possible solutions
==================

Check your realurl data
-----------------------

When I encountered this problem the reason was an invalid entry in the
ID to path mapping of realurl.

The problematic data was inside the page with the UID shown in **yyy**
in the above example of the error message.

I cleared the ID to path mappings in the yyy page and the problem
disappeared.
