Mountpoints and Shortcut Pages
==============================

If you have a shortcut page which links to "first subpage" and the first
subpage is a mountpoint, than you will run into this error.

Do not use "first subpage" if the first visible(!) subpage is a
mountpage. You can select the mountpage as shortcut target - just do not
use the automatic functions ("first subpage", "random subpage"...)

Realurl and Mountpoints
=======================

If you use realurl and mountpoints. It seems that RealUrl cannot/does
not remove the cache entries, if you change a mountpage to a normal
page. If you got this error, go to the mountpoint itself and remove all
cacheentries.

addRootLineFields which are not available
=========================================

If you have set some additional fields in
*$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['addRootLineFields']* which not exists in the
database table *pages*. E.g. You've add realurl related fields in your
localconf.php, LocalConfiguration.php or ext_localconf.php, but forgot
to install ext:realurl or just forgot to do a *DB COMPARE*. If you got
this error, check if you have defined non-existent fields in your
*$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['addRootLineFields']* configuration.
