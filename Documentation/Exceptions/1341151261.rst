Error message
=============

Columns configuration file not found

EXT:ad_google_maps: What did I do prior to experiencing the problem?
====================================================================

This error occured using TYPO3 6.1

After installation of an extension (ad_google_maps) in the extension
manager (EM) the error message appeared whenever I opened a frontend or
backend page.

Apparently this happend to other people with the same extension. They
reported the same error in a (German) board: `Thread
one <http://www.typo3.net/forum/thematik/zeige/thema/114839/>`__ [not
available anymore], `Thread
two <http://www.typo3.net/forum/thematik/zeige/thema/115266/>`__ [not
available anymore]

Reason
------

In ext_tables.php [i]dynamicConfigFile[/i] uses a **relative** path, but
\\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::loadNewTcaColumnsConfigFiles()
expects to get an **absolute** path.

Solution (patch)
----------------

Replace the call of extRelPath() with extPath() for all
*dynamicConfigFile*-entries in the ext_tables.php

Solution (uninstall)
--------------------

#. Edit typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php and remove the extension from
   all lists.
#. Open the install tool in your browser:
   your-typo3-installation.com/typo3/install
#. Use the database analyzer to fix the problem: Click the 'Compare'
   link and see what the install tool suggests to do.
