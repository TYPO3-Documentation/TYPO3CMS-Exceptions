TYPO3 Exception 1274799934

I encountered this issue while working with Value Objects in a rather
complex Object while trying to persist it. After **changing the model
type from Value Object to Entity in the model.php** it worked. I can't
tell what the implications of this change would be for your models but
looking at the discussion `on this
blogpost <http://blog.typoplanet.de/2012/04/19/difference-between-entity-and-valueobject/>`__
[not available anymore] maybe for you there is none.
