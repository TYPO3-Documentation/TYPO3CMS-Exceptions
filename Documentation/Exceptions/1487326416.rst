This error happened on deleting content elements. We had several entries
in table tx_solr_indexqueue_item with "root" pointing to a deleted page.
Clearing the Index Queue did not delete these entries and not solve the
problem. Truncating the table and adding all content anew to the queue
did solve it for me.
