TYPO3 Exception 1534710048
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Exeption is Thrown when click in Backend on Module "Sites"
==========================================================

after Upgrade from TYPO3 LTS 8 or lower to LTS-9 and imported Database
from old instance you want to create Your First SITE configuration, but
get this Exception/CMS/1534710048

Possible Reasons / Solutions
----------------------------

Missing database Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Solution**Â : -> goto Admin Tools -> maintanance -> Database Compare

Exception is thrown when trying to edit records in BE
=====================================================

Error in TCA configuration
--------------------------

**Solution**: Check if display condition 'displayCond' => 'USER:' .
\\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Compatibility\PseudoSiteTcaDisplayCondition::class .
'->isInPseudoSite:pages:false' is used for records. The pseudo site
check should only be used for pages. Remove or adopt display condition.
Problem occured for example in tt_address >= 5.0.0, < 5.2.0 for field
slug.

The error may only occur if you edit specific records as a problem only
arises if a page(!) with the uid of the record(!) does not exist.

**Extension news or tt_address needs updates**
----------------------------------------------

Some versions of the extensions news and tt_address can cause this error
on opening records like sys_category. Updating the extension to the most
recent Version can help. I had the problem with TYPO3 LTS 9 and news
8.4.0
