Hello,

I encountered this error in an extension because I had a TCA
configuration in my ext_tables.php file not suitable for my mySQL table
fields defined in ext_tables.sql

**Note** : this extension was written by a company for specific use 3
years ago and i encountered this error when upgrading from 6.2 LTS to
7.6 LTS.

In my ext_tables.php file i had this code :

::

          $TCA['tx_myExtension_table'] = array(
                  'ctrl' => array(
                  'title'     => $ll.'table.auteur',
                  'label'     => 'nom',
                  'tstamp'    => 'tstamp',
                  'crdate'    => 'crdate',
                  'cruser_id' => 'cruser_id',
                  'type' => 'type',
                  ...
                  ...

And in my ext_tables.sql file :

::

          CREATE TABLE tx_myExtension_table (
                  uid int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
                  pid int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
                  tstamp int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
                  crdate int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
                  cruser_id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
                  sys_language_uid int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
                  ...
                  ...

But i did not have

::

                  type varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',

or an other \`type\` field definition, so it generate an error because
TYPO3 search this field in table in order to follow optional
possibilities like explaned on this link :
https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TCAReference/7.6/Reference/Types/Index.html#optional-possibilities

As i didn't need the \`type\` field, i choose to delete '**type' =>
'type',** in TCA definition.

I choose this after extension code inspection to be sure that \`type\`
field was not required and that the mistake was not a sql definition
oversight. **So look your extension code to know if this solution is
good for you.**

If you need this \`type\` field, i think you need to add a \`type\`
field in your ext_tables.sql file.

After that I did not have this error.

I hope this will be useful to you.
