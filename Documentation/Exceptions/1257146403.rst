Happened to me when I had invalid values for
``<switchableControllerActions>``. My code looked like this:

::

   <numIndex index="1" type="array">
       <numIndex index="0">My Data</numIndex>
       <numIndex index="1">Member->myInvestmentData;Member->show;Member->edit;Member-update;Investment->list;Investment->show;Investment->new;Investment->create;Investment->edit;Investment->update;Investment->delete</numIndex>
   </numIndex>

Notice the missing ``>`` for ``Member-update`` (should be
``Member->update``). Have a look at
`FrontendConfigurationManager <https://typo3.org/api/typo3cms/_frontend_configuration_manager_8php_source.html#l00220>`__
[not available anymore] to see what values are expected.
