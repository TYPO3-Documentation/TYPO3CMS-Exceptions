#1381847136: Could not determine the current charset of the database.
=====================================================================

Did you update MySQL last time and this exception occurred? First verify
if MySQL can check the charsets by running SQL in some GUI:

::

   SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set%';

If it show's you the error like **Table
'performance_schema.session_variables' doesn't exist** you can try to
fix it by the console command:

::

   mysql_upgrade -u root -p --force

(restart MySQL after all)
