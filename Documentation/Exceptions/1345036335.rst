[TYPO3 12] - [17th December 2024]
=================================

Situation
---------

Backend and Frontend only show this exception with the detail:
Could not write log record to log file. 

Solution
--------

#.  If the Install Tool can be opened, go to :guilabel:`Admin Tools >  Environment > Directory Status`
    and check the directory status.
#.  Check if `typo3temp/var/log` and all files therein are writable for TYPO3
#   If the disk is full, you might want to switch to log rotation.
#.  As a last resort: Delete the files in `typo3temp/var/log`. Make a copy first.
