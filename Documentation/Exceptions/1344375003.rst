TYPO3 Exception 1344375003
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


As the message states:

"This usually happens if there is no frontend TypoScript template with
root flag set. Please create a frontend page with a TypoScript root
template."

So you need to create a template on your root page that has the Box
"rootlevel" under options ticked.

Things to note
==============

-  Make sure the root template gets loaded from the root page of your
   page tree. (Even if this is only shortcut to somewhere else.)
-  Make sure non of the basis templates loaded by the root template
   clears Setup/Config.
