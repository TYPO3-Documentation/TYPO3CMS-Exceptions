TYPO3 Exception 1270853884
==========================

::

   TYPO3 Fatal Error: The current username, password or host
   was not accepted when the connection to the database was
   attempted to be established!

Solution 1: restart the MySQL daemon.
=====================================

::

   1. Login as root on your system if you have shell access, or start a console from the server panel.
   2. type: /etc/init.d/mysql restart 
      On Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) type: 
      sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop
   3. If you get this error:

::

   ERROR! The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/mysql/data/<SERVERNAME>.pid)

::

      Then your next option is to kill the mysql process manually by following this instructions:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26263889/starting-mysql-error-the-server-quit-without-updating-pid-file/26266079#26266079
   4. Then restart mysql daemon again. This time it should work.
      On Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) type: 
      sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start

Solution 2: TYPO3 6.2 - modify your MySQL configuration file
============================================================

::

   The problem could depend on recent PHP update from v. 5.3/5.4 to 5.5; a new module is installed: php-mysqlnd. So your TYPO3 attempt to establish a db connect but mysql do not use more your old encription method for the password.
   Proceed as follows:
   1. edit /etc/my.cnf
   2. remove the old_passwords=1 statement
   3. login as root in your server
   4. login to mysql as admin/root (mysql -u root -p)
   5. select database, type: use mysql;
   6. just switched to mysql db change the password of the user:
   update mysql.user set password=PASSWORD('password') where user='db-username'
   obviously substitute db-username with the 'username' and 'password' with the right (old or new password) used to access your db, stored in: typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php
   7. restart your mysql daemon: /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
   8. eventually remove all site cache: rm -rif typo3temp/Cache*
