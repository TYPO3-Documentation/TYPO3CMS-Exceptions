::

   TYPO3 Fatal Error: The current username, password or host
   was not accepted when the connection to the database was
   attempted to be established!

Correct the database settings
-----------------------------

Check your :file:`LocalConfiguration.php` or :file:`AdditionalConfiguration.php` files and verify
that the database connection settings are correct.

Restart the MySQL daemon.
-------------------------

1. Login as root on your system if you have shell access, or start a console from the server panel.
2. type: /etc/init.d/mysql restart
   On Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) type:
   sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop
3. If you get this error::

      ERROR! The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/mysql/data/<SERVERNAME>.pid)

   Then your next option is to kill the mysql process manually by following this instructions:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26263889/starting-mysql-error-the-server-quit-without-updating-pid-file/26266079#26266079
4. Then restart mysql daemon again. This time it should work.
   On Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) type:
   sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start

TYPO3 6.2 - modify your MySQL configuration file
-------------------------------------------------

The problem could depend on recent PHP update from v. 5.3/5.4 to 5.5; a new module is installed: php-mysqlnd. So your TYPO3 attempt to establish a db connect but mysql do not use more your old encryption method for the password.

Proceed as follows:

1. edit /etc/my.cnf
2. remove the old_passwords=1 statement
3. login as root in your server
4. login to mysql as admin/root (mysql -u root -p)
5. select database, type: use mysql;
6. just switched to mysql db change the password of the user::

      update mysql.user set password=PASSWORD('password') where user='db-username'

   obviously substitute db-username with the 'username' and 'password' with the right (old or new password) used to access your db, stored in: typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php
7. restart your mysql daemon: /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
8. eventually remove all site cache: rm -rif typo3temp/Cache\*
