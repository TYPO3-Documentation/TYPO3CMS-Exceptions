If you encounter `Required PageContext not available` check your typo3 log in `var/log/` - if there is log entry like

::
    An exception occurred while executing a query: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'VARCHAR(16383))) AS `__CTE_PATH__`, (CAST(0 <> 0 AS SIGNED INTEGER)) AS `__CT...' at line 1

Your Database version might be too low. Check on get.typo3.org for the supported versions.
When developing with DDEV you might want to run `ddev debug migrate-database mariadb:10.4`.
