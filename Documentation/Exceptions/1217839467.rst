-  Check if you have named the properties correctly in your fluid form
   and in your model class. In my case, this exception occurred simply
   because the property name of the form field in the fluid template did
   not match the property name in the corresponding model class.

-  Check if you have annotated @ignorevalidation $myObject in your
   action (or @dontvalidate for older Extbase version < 6.1)
-  Some hints (in German) can be found here:
