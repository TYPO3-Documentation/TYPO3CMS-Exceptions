TYPO3 Exception 1436717322
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Hello!

I don't know how to fix this error either, but I probably know a way how
it occurred.

With TYPO3 version 10.4.6 it became necessary to do a site
configuration. This is a must with this version.

I accidentally entered a double backslash in "Base URL". (Do not
copy !!) Then this error occurred. The entire backend was no longer
accessible.

I tried to help myself via FTP and edited the file config.yaml. In line
1 I made two backslashes into one. However, this was not successful.

I hope someone can do something with this text. Greetings

For me it was enough to delete "typo3temp". Good luck. SteBo

The parsedUri string appears to be malformed
============================================

Happened to me in TYPO3 9.5 in DDEV on Windows 10 when logging into the
backend after setting up the project with composer and
helhum/typo3-secure-web, helhum/typo3-config-handling.

Solution:

-  Create .env file and set BASE_DOMAIN as your local base url.
-  or set base balue to your base url in config.xml
-  Delete typo3temp, as stated above
