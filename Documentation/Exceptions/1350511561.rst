   Use of Markdown requires the "markdown" shell utility to be installed and accessible; this binary could not be found in any of your configured paths available to this script

This happens with the
`schemaker <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schemaker/>`__
extension.

On Debian, you can install it easily:

::

   $ apt-get install markdown
