TYPO3 Exception 1301648404
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


This exception is thrown when a shortcut page with id X is pointing to a
page with id Y which is not accessible by some reason (example: if page
with id Y is hidden).

The message of this exception is: **This page (ID X) is of type
"Shortcut" and configured to redirect to a page, which is not accessible
(ID Y).**

TYPO3 also sends a 404 header in this case, that should be handled by
the Page Not Found Handler.

**Likeley reasons how this could happen:**

-  The redactor has created a page as shortcut and did not define where
   the shortcut should go to.
-  The page the shortcut pointed to was hidden or removed.

In each case, editing the given page (last parameter of getPageShortcut)
and setting the correct (new) page to shortcut too should solve the
issue.
