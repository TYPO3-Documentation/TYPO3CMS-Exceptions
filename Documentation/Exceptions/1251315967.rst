TYPO3 Exception 1251315967
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

This exception rose in one installation (TYPO3 4.6.9-15) after changing
direction of relations in the
`Extension Builder <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/extension_builder>`__
between two models after having already inserted some entries to the list-view
in the backend.

Deleting the files *typo3conf/temp_CACHED_\** and truncating the
caching-framework-tables beginning with *cf\_* helped for me.

// Additional Situations, observed in TYPO3 6.1.2, Extbase 6 This
exception is also thrown when, in the course of development:

- a variable is changed, e.g. from CamelCase to non-CamelCase::

      protected $pressReview
      protected $pressreview

- a variable annotation is changed, e.g. from CamelCase to
  Non-CamelCase::

      /**
       * @var \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage<\Vendor\MyExtension\Domain\Model\PressReviews>
       */

      /**
       * @var \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage<\Vendor\MyExtension\Domain\Model\Pressreviews>
       */

(Working in the files directly, not using the Extension Builder
[anymore]) In my case, the truncating of the cf\_-tables was
sufficient.

Extension Builder bug
=====================

In another case, this occurred in the Extension Builder v6.2.0 after the
modification of an extension via the Extension Builder to add a new
model object and relate it in a 1:n relation. The previously created
model, which was meant to hold a set (n) of the new model, was missing
the new model in the new dependency injections. The code generated was
missing the new model's extbase path.

To fix this:

-  Find all sections where the new model path is missing and add it

   -  e.g. from \\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage<> to
      \\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage<\{VendorName}\{Ext}\Domain\Model\{NewModel}>
      in the protected variable
   -  in the get/set/add/edit functions in the body, e.g. the 'add'
      function

::

     /**
     * Adds a {newModel}
     *
     * @param ${newModel}
     * @return void
     */

      Change to

     /**
     * Adds a {newModel}
      *
     * @param \{VendorName}\{Ext}\Domain\Model\{NewModel} ${newModel}
     * @return void
     */


-  Clear TYPO3 Caches
-  Delete typo3temp/\*
-  As stated before, truncating the cf\_-tables was needed before the
   error stopped.
-  May also be caused by incorrectly formatted comments - a missing \* on
   the first line (only having one star) will stop the parser finding the
   definitions.
-  The error occurs also if you have missing annotation in your model.
