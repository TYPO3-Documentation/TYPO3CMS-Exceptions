TYPO3 Exception 1260881688
==========================

.. note::
If you encountered this exception, please help others by providing
information about how you got this error. Especially if you have a solution,
please add it to this page by following the :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" workflow
<docs-contribute-github-method>`!

If this error occurs when you use a $this -> redirect( ... ), try $this
-> forward( ... ) instead. You can do this but its absolutely not
recommended because you are bypassing domain validation with the
forward() method!

| 
| The error occurs if there is a newly created Domain Object where the
  attribute uid is not set. This happens because newly created Domain
  Objects were not persisted directly after adding them to a repository.
  You have to get an instance of the PersistenceManager
  $persistenceManager =
  $this->objectManager->get('TYPO3\\CMS\\Extbase\\Persistence\\Generic\\PersistenceManager')
  and persist it by hand with $persistenceManager->persistAll().
