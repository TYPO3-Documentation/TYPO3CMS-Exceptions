TYPO3 Exception 1441706370
==========================

TYPO3 7.6.15:

::

   #1441706370: Button "TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Template\Components\Buttons\LinkButton" is not valid
    InvalidArgumentException thrown in file
    typo3_src/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Template/Components/ButtonBar.php in line 66.

Reason: URL, title or icon is empty.

Addtion to this correct, but very brief answer: One reason may be a
missing language file. Imagine you check out a Typo3-page from git
locally and also use a copy of the database/configuration of this site.
Then, perhaps, the configured language is missing on your system. (For
me it was german and the quick fix was to disable it via "Languages".)
