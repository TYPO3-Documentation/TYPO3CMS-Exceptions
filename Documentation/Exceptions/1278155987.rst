.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Check the XML-File announced, if it is well formated with an
XML-Validator. Occurs when a tag name is not well closed (example :
<label></labe>).

This error might also occur if the file has the wrong encoding. Try to
use UTF-8 (without BOM). If the file is a language file, also check all
other language versions. For example, if the error is shown for
locallang_db.xlf, in fact, the error might be caused by
de.locallang_db.xlf.
