Misspelled folder name in icon path
===================================

| I've encoutered the exception that "source" is mandatory during icon
  rendering.
| This was because I misspelled a folder name in the icon path using
  "EXT:...".
| It could not be resolved and therefor the icon path was empty in the
  end.

Cache
=====

Clearing the cache via the install tool fixed the error for me

Other
=====

i received following exception when i installed the following extensions
/\* 'svconnector' => [

::

              'packagePath' => 'typo3conf/ext/svconnector/',
          ],
          'external_import' => [
              'packagePath' => 'typo3conf/ext/external_import/',
          ],*/

I tried to comment out the 2 extensions in PackageStates.php but i still
i cannot login as administrator.

What must i do ?

Thanks Gerard

I had a similar problem with the same error-code but in a local ddev
server. I used ddev v. 0.18.0 - where the error came out and updated to
ddev 1.3.0 there the error was gone.
