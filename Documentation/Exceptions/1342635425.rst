TYPO3 Exception 1342635425

Could not access remote resource "..."
======================================

If this error comes directly after installation, activate cUrl support
in Install-Tool.

.. code-block::

   [SYS][curlUse] = 1

If you use a local XAMPP Installation and the error still occurs with
cUrl, than it's maybe a problem with the certificate. The problem is
cUrl quit with this message "SSL certificate problem: unable to get
local issuer certificate".

-  Get the **cacert.pem** from http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
   and put this line in at the end of your :file:`php.ini` :bash:`curl.cainfo=PATH/To/your/cacert.pem`
-  restart Apache/Xampp and all should work.
