If this error comes directly after installation, activate cUrl support
in Install-Tool.

[SYS][curlUse] = 1

Had this issue after fresh installation on XAMPP on Windows 7 with
symlinks (mklink). curlUse = 1 worked for me.

| If you use a local XAMPP Installation and the error still occurs with
  cUrl, than it's maybe a problem with the certificate. The problem is
  cUrl quit with this message "SSL certificate problem: unable to get
  local issuer certificate". I could solve this issue with this step-by
  step Guide from this blog:

  [not available anymore]

| (in short and english):
| Get the **cacert.pem** from http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
  and put this line in at the end of your php.ini

| **curl.cainfo=PATH/To/your/cacert.pem**
| restart Apache/Xampp and all should work.
