TYPO3 Exception 1232985914
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The PHP extension "apcu" must be installed and loaded in order to use the APCu backend.
=======================================================================================

#. Install and configure apc on the server. Maybe APCu is installed, but
   needs more memory.
#. Goto TYPO3 *Install Tool* --> *Configuration Presets* and
   choose *Database cache backend* (or: something different then `apcu`) and save.
#. On a Hetzner server: Disable, save and then re-enable APC in Hetzner server management console to get
it fixed.
