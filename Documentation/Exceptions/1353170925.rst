TYPO3 Exception 1353170925

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


The relation information for property "propertyXX" of class "TX\ext_key\Domain\Model\SomeModelYY" is missing.
=============================================================================================================

If you have a propery in a class SomeModelYY which has another class as
type

::

          /**
           * @var TX\ext_key\Domain\Model\SomeOtherModelZZ
           */
          protected $propertyXX;


the object will be populated by extbase without any other configuration.

But to make queries like

::

     $query->like("propertyXX.someproperty", '%foo%')

work, you still have to declare a 'foreign_table' in your TCA.

Also be sure, to have the properties with getter and setter in your
model.
