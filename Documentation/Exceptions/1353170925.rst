TYPO3 Exception 1353170925
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The relation information for property "..." of class "..." is missing.
======================================================================

If you have a property in a class `SomeModelYY` which has another class as
type

.. code-block:: php

   /**
   * @var TX\ext_key\Domain\Model\SomeOtherModelZZ
   */
   protected $propertyXX;


the object will be populated by extbase without any other configuration.

But to make queries like

.. code-block:: php

   $query->like("propertyXX.someproperty", '%foo%')

work, you still have to declare a :php:`foreign_table` in your TCA.

Also make sure you have the properties with corresponding getters and setters in your
model.
