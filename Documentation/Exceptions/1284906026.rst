When trying to user feedit_advanced I get the following error (cannot
find any error in logs):

**Oops, an error occurred! Language and character encoding are not set.
More information regarding this error might be available online**

Any idea how to fix this? - I don't have this issue with beta
releases :(

Best regards,

Stelli
