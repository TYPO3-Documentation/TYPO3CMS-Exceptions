#1166546734 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Package\Exception\UnknownPackageException
====================================================================

Reason 1:
---------

-  Package does really not exist

Reason 2:
---------

.. container::

   |Extension Upload screen TER.png|

-  CamelCaseConversion Problem with numbers
-  f.e. vendor_extension_2018 will be converted into VendorExtension2018
   and converted back into vendor_extension2018

This will result in the following error message:

   Package "vendor_extension2018" is not available. Please check if the
   package exists and that the package key is correct (package keys are
   case sensitive)

According to the hints in TER these kind of keys are invalid:

Reason 3:

   1/1) #1166546734 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Package\Exception\UnknownPackageException
   Package "" is not available. Please check if the package exists and that the package key is correct (package keys are case sensitive).
   
Happened on switching from LTS 9 to 10 as :php:`$_EXTKEY` is no more defined. Therefore I called::

   \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::registerPlugin(
        'VENDOR.' . $extensionKey,
        'Pi1',
        'LLL:EXT:...'
    );
    
With an empty :php:`$extensionKey`
