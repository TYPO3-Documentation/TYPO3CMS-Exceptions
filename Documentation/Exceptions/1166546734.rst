-  CamelCaseConversion Problem with numbers
-  f.e. vendor_extension_2018 will be converted into VendorExtension2018
   and converted back into vendor_extension2018

This will result in the following error message:

**Package "vendor_extension2018" is not available. Please check if the
package exists and that the package key is correct (package keys are
case sensitive)**

According to the hints in TER these kind of keys are invalid:

Reason 3 - Unknown
------------------

On a new Typo3 8LTS installation with test page and empty database comes
this error message in Backend: "Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1166546734:
Package "core" is not available..." If typo3temp/var/cache is emptied,
the installation will work for a few minutes. The "missing" package
varies in the error message until "rte_ckeditor" and
"fluid_styled_content" have been deactivated. Now the error message
appears only with Package "core".
