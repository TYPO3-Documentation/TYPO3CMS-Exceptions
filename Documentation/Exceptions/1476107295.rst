PHP Warning: session_start():

files in the temp folder (or creating the folder by hand if it doesn't
exist)

After upgrading from TYPO3 7.6.23 to TYPO3 8.7.9, I am getting this
error most of the time that I login to the Backend. After I delete the
folder "var" in "typo3temp", the next Backend login succeeds. See:
`File:Backend Login Exception.pdf <files/Backend_Login_Exception.pdf>`__

1476107295: PHP Warning: Illegal offset type in
/html/typo3/typo3_src-8.7.10/typo3/sysext/rte_ckeditor/Classes/Controller/BrowseLinksController.php
line 234

(vers. 8.7) The error occured in CKEditor Rich Text Editor while setting
a link. This was because of the page-TS-config for the old rte html
Editor. After deleting the page TS config for RTE everything works as
expected again.

The error occur if the function in a extended class has different
arguments

I'm getting this error after the update from TYPO3 8.7 to 9.5 while
rendering a template which contains JavaScript in the
FluidTYPO3\Vhs\ViewHelpers\Asset\ScriptViewHelper.

--------------

After upgrading from TYPO3 8 to 9 I got this error because PHP Cache is
loading the files out of the old TYPO3 8 source dir. After removing the
old typo3_src-8.x.x dir or reloading the webserver the paths are
correct.

--------------

I had the same code of error:

Core: Exception handler (WEB): Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1476107295:
PHP Warning: key() expects parameter 1 to be array, string given in
/home/host/data/www/typo3_src-9.5.9/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Configuration/TypoScript/ConditionMatching/ConditionMatcher.php

/home/host/data/www/typo3_src-9.5.9/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Error/ErrorHandler.php
in line 124. Requested URL: ...

It is happened because of my "_GP('edit')" coincided with
"$editStatement = GeneralUtility::_GP('edit');".

My solution: I change from "edit" to "redact", now I do not get this
error.

--------------

Got this error because PHP version was higher (7.3.8) than supported by
Ext:mask. No problems under PHP 7.2.21.

I got this error:

*"Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1476107295: PHP Warning: preg_match():
Compilation failed: regular expression is too large at offset 27 in
/html/typo3/typo3_src-9.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/ContentObject/ContentObjectRenderer.php

*This is the code in row 3473: if (preg_match($cropRegEx, $tempContent,
$croppedMatch)) { ... and in the image you see the content of the 3
parameters"*

Reason here:

Ext. "news": An editor created a text in a news-article (RTE) with
**only 1 (ONE) paragraph**. In the raw data, there was no html-tag, only
the beginning <p> and the endeing </p> and the text had more than **3410
letters**!

After splitting this ONE paragraph into 3 paragraphs, the above
mentioned error was gone!

Calling typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 scheduler:run from CLI:

Uncaught TYPO3 Exception #1476107295: PHP Runtime Deprecation Notice:

Solution: Disable Debug ModeÂ ;)

--------------

When gridelements is enabled in debug mode, this error comes currently
in V10.4.12 - disable the ext, when you are in debug mode and you are
good to go.
