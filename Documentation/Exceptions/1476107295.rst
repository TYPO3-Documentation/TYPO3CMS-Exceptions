After upgrading from TYPO3 7.6.23 to TYPO3 8.7.9, I am getting this
error most of the time that I login to the Backend. After I delete the
folder "var" in "typo3temp", the next Backend login succeeds. See:
`File:Backend Login Exception.pdf <files/Backend_Login_Exception.pdf>`__

/html/typo3/typo3_src-8.7.10/typo3/sysext/rte_ckeditor/Classes/Controller/BrowseLinksController.php
line 234

(vers. 8.7) The error occured in CKEditor Rich Text Editor while setting
a link. This was because of the page-TS-config for the old rte html
Editor. After deleting the page TS config for RTE everything works as
expected again.

I'm getting this error after the update from TYPO3 8.7 to 9.5 while
rendering a template which contains JavaScript in the
FluidTYPO3\Vhs\ViewHelpers\Asset\ScriptViewHelper.

--------------

After upgrading from TYPO3 8 to 9 I got this error because PHP Cache is
loading the files out of the old TYPO3 8 source dir. After removing the
old typo3_src-8.x.x dir or reloading the webserver the paths are
correct.

--------------

I had the same code of error:

Core: Exception handler (WEB): Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1476107295:
PHP Warning: key() expects parameter 1 to be array, string given in
/home/host/data/www/typo3_src-9.5.9/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Configuration/TypoScript/ConditionMatching/ConditionMatcher.php

/home/host/data/www/typo3_src-9.5.9/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Error/ErrorHandler.php
in line 124. Requested URL: ...

It is happened because of my "_GP('edit')" coincided with
"$editStatement = GeneralUtility::_GP('edit');".

My solution: I change from "edit" to "redact", now I do not get this
error.

--------------

Got this error because PHP version was higher (7.3.8) than supported by
Ext:mask. No problems under PHP 7.2.21.

I got this error:

*"Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1476107295: PHP Warning: preg_match():
Compilation failed: regular expression is too large at offset 27 in
/html/typo3/typo3_src-9.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/ContentObject/ContentObjectRenderer.php

*This is the code in row 3473: if (preg_match($cropRegEx, $tempContent,
$croppedMatch)) { ... and in the image you see the content of the 3
parameters"*

Reason here:

Ext. "news": An editor created a text in a news-article (RTE) with
**only 1 (ONE) paragraph**. In the raw data, there was no html-tag, only
the beginning <p> and the endeing </p> and the text had more than **3410
letters**!

After splitting this ONE paragraph into 3 paragraphs, the above
mentioned error was gone!

Calling typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 scheduler:run from CLI:

Solution: Disable Debug Mode ;)

--------------

When gridelements is enabled in debug mode, this error comes currently
in V10.4.12 - disable the ext, when you are in debug mode and you are
good to go.
