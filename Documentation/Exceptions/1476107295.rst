After upgrading from TYPO3 7.6.23 to TYPO3 8.7.9, I am getting this

where dev/sda2 is the corrupted disk.

PHP Warning: Illegal offset type
================================

:

   typo3/sysext/rte_ckeditor/Classes/Controller/BrowseLinksController.php
   line 234

(TYPO3 8.7) The error occurred in CKEditor Rich Text Editor while setting
a link. This was caused by the pageTSconfig for the old rte html
Editor. After deleting the pageTSconfig for the old RTE everything works as
expected again.

Using sb_portfolio2
===================

::

   1476107295: PHP Warning: Declaration of
   Tx_SbPortfolio2_Domain_Repository_CategoryRepository::findByTags(Tx_SbPortfolio2_Domain_Model_Tag
   $tag) should be compatible with

Vhs ScriptViewHelper
====================

I'm getting this error after the update from TYPO3 8.7 to 9.5 while
rendering a template which contains JavaScript in the
FluidTYPO3\Vhs\ViewHelpers\Asset\ScriptViewHelper.

Upgrading from TYPO3 8 to 9
===========================

After upgrading from TYPO3 8 to 9 I got this error because PHP Cache is
loading the files out of the old TYPO3 8 source dir. After removing the
old typo3_src-8.x.x dir or reloading the webserver the paths are
correct.

PHP Warning: key() expects parameter 1  to be array, string given in ConditionMatcher.php
=========================================================================================

::

   PHP Warning: key() expects parameter 1 to be array, string given in
   /home/host/data/www/typo3_src-9.5.9/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Configuration/TypoScript/ConditionMatching/ConditionMatcher.php


It is happened because of my "_GP('edit')" coincided with
"$editStatement = GeneralUtility::_GP('edit');".

My solution: I change from "edit" to "redact", now I do not get this
error.

PHP version to high
===================

Got this error because PHP version was higher (7.3.8) than supported by
Ext:mask. No problems under PHP 7.2.21.


PHP Warning: preg_match(): Compilation failed: regular expression is too large
==============================================================================

::

   "Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1476107295: PHP Warning: preg_match():
   Compilation failed: regular expression is too large at offset 27 in
   /html/typo3/typo3_src-9.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/ContentObject/ContentObjectRenderer.php


Reason here:
------------

Ext. news: An editor created a text in a news-article (RTE) with
**only 1 (ONE) paragraph**. In the raw data, there was no html-tag, only
the beginning :html:`<p>` and the ending :html:`</p>` and the text had more than
**3410 letters**

Solution
--------

After splitting this ONE paragraph into 3 paragraphs, the above
mentioned error was gone

::

   Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated in

   line 479

Solution
--------

Disable Debug Mode

Extension gridelements in debug mode
====================================

When gridelements is enabled in debug mode, this error comes currently
in V10.4.12 - disable the ext, when you are in debug mode and you are
good to go.



PHP Warning: Undefined array key "<field>" in InlineRecordContainer.php
===============================================================================

Using TYPO3v11 with PHP 8.0 this error occurs because of an invalid TCA configuration.

Solution
--------

Check your TCA files, if inside ctrl-Section fields are defined, which aren't defined in columns, e.g. hidden.
Remove the entry in ctrl section or make clear definition of enabledColumn in column section.
