TYPO3 Exception 1301648780
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

When clicking on Show in the backend, this error occurs when an item is
disabled, instead it should show the preview of the page.

In LTS 9 this exception occurs when the rootPageId in the site config
(config/sites/domainname/config.yaml) does not match the pageId of the
page that is set as Rootpage.

The Exception occurred **after** the update of the core system to
version 6.2.5.

The Exception occurred after updating to 6.2.9. When editing a
tx_cal_event (/typo3/alt_doc.php?edit[tx_cal_event][135]=edit) and using
any of the "Save"-Links, the Error "Page Not Found (404) The requested
page does not exist!" is shown and nothing is saved. The resulting URL
is /typo3/alt_doc.php?&edit[tx_cal_event][135]=edit&returnUrl=dummy.php
which might hold two hints: dummy.php and the missing key/value in the
query string directly after the question mark.

| 
| **SOLUTION** A customer of mine had the same problem. The solution
  was, that the SysFolder had a Page TSconfig entry
  **options.tx_cal_controller.pageIDForPlugin = 419** The page 419 had
  been deleted. As I removed that option, cal worked again. So be sure
  to check the page TSconfig for wrong entries

| 
| This exception will also be thrown if an extension is passing an empty
  argument to the **pageRenderer** functions addCssFile and
  addJsFooterFile (tested on TYPO3 7.6.6).
