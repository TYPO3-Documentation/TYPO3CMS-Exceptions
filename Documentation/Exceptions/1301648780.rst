PageNotFoundException
=====================

Wrong Site Configuration
-------------------------

In LTS 9 this exception occurs when the rootPageId in the site config
(:file:`config/sites/domainname/config.yaml`) does not match the pageId of the
page that is set as root page.

Wrong preview/extension configuration
-------------------------------------

The Exception occurred after updating to 6.2.9. When editing a
`tx_cal_event` (:file:`/typo3/alt_doc.php?edit[tx_cal_event][135]=edit`) and using
any of the "Save"-Links, the Error "Page Not Found (404) The requested
page does not exist!" is shown and nothing is saved. The resulting URL
is `/typo3/alt_doc.php?&edit[tx_cal_event][135]=edit&returnUrl=dummy.php`
which might hold two hints: dummy.php and the missing key/value in the
query string directly after the question mark.

**SOLUTION** The solution was, that the SysFolder had a Page TSconfig entry
:typoscript:`options.tx_cal_controller.pageIDForPlugin = 419`. The page 419 had
been deleted. After removing the option cal worked again. So be sure
to check the page TSconfig for wrong entries
