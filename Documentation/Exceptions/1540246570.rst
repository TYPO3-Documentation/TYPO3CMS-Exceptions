TYPO3 Exception 1540246570
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

It happens when i create a content element of type Plugin and forget to
choose the specific Plugin from the tab 'Plug-in'

--------------

Occures if you pass the wrong pluginType to
TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin(...)

You have removed Typoscript by Conditon?
=========================================

f.e. you have used this:

::

     [globalVar = TSFE:id = {$noLoginPluginOnPids}]
     
     lib.login >

     [global]

This will lead to this Exception since TYPO3 LTS 9 if you use something
like the next line in your Fluid Template <f:cObject
typoscriptObjectPath="lib.login" />

Solution
--------

change typoscript to:

::

     [globalVar = TSFE:id = {$noLoginPluginOnPids}]

     lib.login =

     [global]

Exception is thrown in a fluid template using a view helper
===========================================================

Might be caused by a translation not found in Fluid:

.. code-block:: xml

       <f:translate key = "Button_Helpful" />

If translation key is not found in the default language file, this error
will be thrown.


Solution
========

add a default text to the tag and also fix the language file.

The error does not occur when you use the Fluid lanuage tag with a path:

.. code-block:: xml

       <f:translate key = "LLL:EXT:yourExtension/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xml:Button_Helpful" />
