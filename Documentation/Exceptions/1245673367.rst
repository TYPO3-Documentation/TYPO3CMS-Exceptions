TYPO3 Exception 1245673367
==========================

I get this error after installing an Extension which tries to use a
Class not defined in any of the typical Extbase Autoloader locations.

::

   Oops, an error occurred!

   The given class "Tx_Extname_Classname" is not a registered object.

Occours in: typo3/sysext/extbase/Classes/SignalSlot/Dispatcher.php:117

| - - - yes i got the same. caused by mismatch between the classname in
  the signalslot (in ext_tables.php) and the namespace/classname
  combination (full-qualified class name) in
  Classes/Controller/XxxController.php

- - - In my case the exeption is thrown, when I try to install a
dev-version of gridelements-e4ca690 by hand, i.e. by putting it into the
ext directory and then activating it with the extension tool in the
backend. Since I'm a newby to autoloading etc. the question is: Is this
an error in the .json file of the extension or am I using the wrong
procedure by installing it manually? In the latter case the the
exception is correct, nevertheless it should state that I have to use
composer to install dev-versions. The question then is: How do I install
dev-versions from outside the official repository with composer?

- - - I uninstalled compatibility7 and the error was gone...
