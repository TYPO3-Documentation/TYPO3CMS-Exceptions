Error: $className must be a non empty string.

When: When executing 8.7.4 "Execute database migrations on single rows"
upgrade wizard. On Windows 7 IIS. Upgrade from fresh 7.6.21 install.

Solution: Upgrade Core to 8.7.24

TYPO3 9.5.10
============

Error has occurred on calling findAll(). The mistake was, that one
property in the model missed the type in the @var anotaion. A little bit
confusing. Found the problem on debugging DataMapper.
