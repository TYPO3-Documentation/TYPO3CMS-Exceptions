TYPO3 Exception 1438594406
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

No columns definition in TCA table
==================================

On possible cause for this is the use of old :file:`ext_tables.php`/TCA
configuration. Please see
https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Changelog/7.6/Index.html
for the changes in TYPO3. Also, the TCA file must return the array, not
only declare it, as would work before.
