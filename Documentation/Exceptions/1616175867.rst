   :caption: Exception message upon failed login

   (1/1) #1616175867 TYPO3\CMS\Core\RateLimiter\RequestRateLimitedException

   The login is locked until 26-06-22 12:33 due to too many failed login attempts from your IP address.

This exception is thrown, when there have been too many failed login attempts from one IP address within a given time frame.

See also: :ref:`ext_core:feature-93825`.

Solution
--------

1. Wait for the lock to time out.
2. If the limit is too short for your purposes, make the limit higher.
3. During Development: Deleting the cache folder `var/cache/data/ratelimiter/` manually enables login right away again.
