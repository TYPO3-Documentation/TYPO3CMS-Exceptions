Problem:
========

Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1327065745: Unsupported or non-existing
property name "categories" used in relation matching.

Cause:
======

Caching TCA information changed in v8.

Solution:
=========

From the core `API
docs <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/ApiOverview/Categories/Index.html#making-a-table-categorizable>`__:

The second way is to call
\\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::makeCategorizable().
This method adds a new entry into the registry managed by
\\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Category\CategoryRegistry. The registry will take care
of adding the relevant $TCA definition to create a field for making
relations to the system categories. The call to **makeCategorizable()
must be located in an extension's Configuration/TCA/Overrides folder**
(or ext_tables.php file before TYPO3 CMS 6.2.1).

Problem:
========

Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1327065745: Unsupported or non-existing
property name "<propertyName>" used in relation matching.

.. _cause-1:

Cause:
======

Use of 1:1 relation in domain model but querying it as a n:m relation.

.. _solution-1:

Solution:
=========

The query must use equals() for 1:1 relation. If you use contains()
extbase will expects a 1:n or n:m relation.
