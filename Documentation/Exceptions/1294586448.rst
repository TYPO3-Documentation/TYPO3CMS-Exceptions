Editors cannot upload files in media extension
==============================================

When a editor (a backend user that is not an administrator) tries to
access a module to where they have no access to an exception like this
will be thrown:

::

   Core: Exception handler (WEB):
   Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1294586448: Access Error: You don't have access to this module.
   RuntimeException thrown in file /var/www/html/vendor/typo3/cms/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Authentication/BackendUserAuthentication.php in line 448.

In the media extension this happens if the access to the modules is not
configured properly.

Check the following access: A backend user with access to "File>Media"
must also granted to "User tools > Media Extra (hidden module, required
for non admin)".
