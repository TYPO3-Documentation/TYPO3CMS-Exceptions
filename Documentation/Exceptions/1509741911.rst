   (1/2) #1509741911 TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\Exception
   Folder "/testing/foo/file.png/" does not exist.
   in /var/www/site/htdocs/typo3_src/typo3/sysext/fluid/Classes/ViewHelpers/ImageViewHelper.php line 175

This exception happens if an image file should be rendered in Fluid,
but failed because the file does not exist:

A simple workaround is to (re)create the image/folder at the desired
location or to change the path in the used extension.
