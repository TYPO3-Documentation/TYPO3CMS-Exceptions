This error can be caused by a mis-spelled vendor name.

The vendor name (first part of the namespaced class name) must start
with a capital letter to work correctly with Extbase. Otherwise PHP
class names start with a small letter while the Extbase types start with
a capital letter what will cause problems.

| Make sure the type of each variable is defined in your model:
  extensionname/Classes/Domain/Model/\* Set the "@var" in the header

::

   /**
   * aString
   *
   * @var string
   */
   protected $aString;
