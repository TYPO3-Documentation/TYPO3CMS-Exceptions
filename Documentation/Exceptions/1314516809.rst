File "..." does not exist
=========================

Check case sensitivity setting in \`File storage\` record
---------------------------------------------------------

Most problems arise when you are migrating from a case-insensitive to a
case-sensitive file system, or when an auto-generated File Storage didn't
recognize case-sensitivity correctly.

In such a situation the created :guilabel:`File storage` saves file identifiers with
lower-case in the database and can't find files which have mixed-case file names.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Find all :guilabel:`File Storages` via module :guilabel:`List` on `page zero` and on tab
:guilabel:`Configuration` check the :guilabel:`Uses case sensitive identifiers`
checkbox.

Other possibilities
-------------------

-  This error occurs when a media resource (image, PDF) is deleted from
   the server but remains linked via the "media" extension and FAL.

-  The message appears when the file is in the directory, but not the
   record in the DB.

-  It happens when you upload a file with the name in uppercase.
   The file has been uploaded, but the reference record is not created.
   Solution: delete the file from the directory and upload the file in
   lowercase (and check if setting "case sensitivity" in :guilabel:`File Storage`
   record is set correctly).

Situation: Entering Upgrade Wizard after upgrading to 8.7
---------------------------------------------------------

Exception gets thrown when entering Upgrade Wizard:

::

   Uncaught TYPO3 Exception
   #1314516809: File /user_upload//foto_ba\'s.JPG does not exist. (More information)


The file does exist but is still referenced.

**Important** Set configuration presets to "Debug" to see where problem
occurs (You should not do this in production system though).

**Workaround:**

For this specific case: (the exception may be caused by other things,
though)

-  "Fix" the filename.
-  Mark FormFileExtensionUpdate as done

Situation: Upgrade from 6.1 to 6.2
------------------------------------

This error occurs at this step of the upgrade process :

Migrate all RTE magic images from :file:`uploads/RTEmagicC_\*` to
:file:`fileadmin/_migrated/RTE/`

The solution is to update the general reference index (:sql:`sys_refindex`) via
the TYPO3 Backend:

TYPO3 backend, :guilabel:`ADMIN TOOLS > DB check > Manage Reference Index`

Situation: Upgrading from very old DAM versions
-----------------------------------------------

DAM versions up to 1.1.7 allowed users to circumvent TYPO3's file and
folder name sanitization, so users could enter files containing e.g.
space characters. While that may not have caused any issues on TYPO3
4.x, it will result in various obscure errors in 6.x, not just this
exception.

DAM 1.1.8 added sanitization but still failed to sanitize folder names
when renaming existing folders. This issue has been fixed later (at
latest on 1.2.4, exact release not identified yet).

As 1.1.8 fixed most of these issues and was released just one day (25
January 2011) before TYPO3 4.5 you should only encounter this issue on
very old TYPO3/DAM installations.

**Solution:** Identify all file paths containing spaces which are
currently in use (to keep amount of work low) via database and rename
them manually. Warn your editors to check file names if currently unused
files are affected (simply remove the ``number_of_references`` condition
below). Assuming reference index is reliable:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM sys_file WHERE identifier LIKE "% %" AND number_of_references > 0;
