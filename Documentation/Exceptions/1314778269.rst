TYPO3 Exception 1314778269
==========================

Description
===========

Exception 1314778269 **'Cannot add a file that is already part of this
storage.'** is thrown in
TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Driver\LocalDriver::addFile.

upgraded from TYPO3 4.5 to 6.1
------------------------------

We're getting this error after saving an calender item (extension cal
1.6.0) in a project that was recently upgraded from TYPO3 4.5 to 6.1.
The content of the calender item has a reference to an existing image
uploads/RTEmagicC_btn_reserveren_39.jpg.jpg (where did the '.jpg.jpg'
come from!?).

FAL: addFile()
--------------

I'm getting this error when adding a sys_file to my FAL storage
$this->storage->addFile($localFilePath, $targetFolder, $targetFileName)
The problem was that my first parameter $localFilePath was an absolute
path instead of a relative path. Wrong:
my/absolute/path/www/fileadmin/myfile.jpg Correct: fileadmin/myfile.jpg
