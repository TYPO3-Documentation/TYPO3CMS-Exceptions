FAL: addFile()
--------------

Error when adding a :sql:`sys_file` to a FAL storage
via `$this->storage->addFile($localFilePath, $targetFolder, $targetFileName)`:

The exception is thrown when the `$localFilePath` (the source file) is already located anywhere
inside of the target's FAL local storage path. For example, inside of :file:`fileadmin/` when using the default
local storage.
