TYPO3 7.6.0
===========

Error when opening backend login after upgrading from 7.x:

::

   Core: Exception handler (WEB): Uncaught TYPO3 Exception: #1433416043: 
   The login provider "1433416748" defines an invalid provider. 
   Ensure the class exists and implements the "TYPO3\CMS\Backend\LoginProvider\LoginProviderInterface".
   RuntimeException thrown in file /typo3_src-7.6.0/typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Controller/LoginController.php in line 458.

Solution
--------

| Flush all caches via "Clear all cache" button in the Install Tool.
| (Explanation: The openid login form is registered with its old
  namespace and this registration is cached. Removing the cache will
  refresh the configration, which contains the right reference to the
  new namespace.)
