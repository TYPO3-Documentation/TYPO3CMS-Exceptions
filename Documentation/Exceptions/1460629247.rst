TYPO3 Exception 1460629247
==========================

TYPO3 8.7.1
===========

Error: No valid handlers found for type: javascript
---------------------------------------------------

Happens after saving in CKEditor.

You may have received this error, because you are trying to save a
non-compliant link in CKEditor. Usually CKEditor will eliminate (remove)
such links - but in combination with
`extraAllowedContent <https://usetypo3.com/ckeditor.html#c405>`__ it
might happen that the link passes the filter.

For example, this would cause the error above:

::

      href="/impressum/"

Valid links would be:

::

      href="t3://page?uid=175"
      href="https://typo3.org"
