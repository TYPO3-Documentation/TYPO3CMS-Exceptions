TYPO3 v12.3 - 2023-03-30
========================

The issue
---------

With TYPO3 v12.3 the items of the TCA types "check", "radio" and "select" requires
a "label" key instead of the array index "0". In v12 a TCA migration is in place which
is not applied to custom site configurations in v12.3.

..  seealso::
    *   `Feature: #99739 - Associative array keys for TCA items <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Changelog/12.3/Feature-99739-AssociativeArrayKeysForTCAItems.html>`__
    *   `Bug: #100359 - Using TCA type "checkbox" in custom site configuration field throws error <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/100359>`__

Solution
--------

Migrate from:

..  code-block:: php

    'config' => [
        'type' => 'check',
        'renderType' => 'checkboxToggle',
        'items' => [[
            0 => '',
            1 => '',
        ]],
    ]

to:

..  code-block:: php

    'config' => [
        'type' => 'check',
        'renderType' => 'checkboxToggle',
        'items' => [[
            'label' => '',
            'value' => '',
        ]],
    ]

To stay compatible with TYPO3 v12 and v11, use:

..  code-block:: php

    'config' => [
        'type' => 'check',
        'renderType' => 'checkboxToggle',
        'items' => [[
            0 => '',
            1 => '',
            'label' => '',
            'value' => '',
        ]],
    ]
