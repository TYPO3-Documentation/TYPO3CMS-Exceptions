TYPO3 v12.3 - 2023-03-30
========================

The issue
---------
   
With TYPO3 v12.3 the items of the TCA types "check", "radio" and "select" requires
a "label" key instead of the array index "0". In v12 a TCA migration is in place which
is not applied to custom site configurations in v12.3.

   *  `Bug: #100359 - Using TCA type "checkbox" in custom site configuration field throws error <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/100359>`__
   
Solution
--------

Migrate from:
   
.. code-block:: php
   
  'config' => [
      'type' => 'check',
      'renderType' => 'checkboxToggle',
      'items' => [[
          0 => '',
          1 => '',
      ]],
  ]
 
to:
 
.. code-block:: php
   
  'config' => [
      'type' => 'check',
      'renderType' => 'checkboxToggle',
      'items' => [[
          'label' => '',
          'value' => '',
      ]],
  ]
 
To stay compatible with TYPO3 v12 and v11, use:

.. code-block:: php
   
  'config' => [
      'type' => 'check',
      'renderType' => 'checkboxToggle',
      'items' => [[
          0 => '',
          1 => '',
          'label' => '',
          'value' => '',
      ]],
  ]
