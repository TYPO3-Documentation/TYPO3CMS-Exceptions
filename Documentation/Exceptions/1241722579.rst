(1/1) #1241722579 TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\Exception

"@" could not be parsed by \\DateTime constructor:
DateTime::__construct(): Failed to parse time string (@) at position 0
(@): Unexpected character

Solution
========

Adjust usage of viewHelper to respect the requirements.

Cases where it can happen are beside general faults that an extension is
updated and the templates are outdated.
