Flux
====

Error:

::

   > The property "options.Fluidcontent.sorting" on the subject was not accessible.

Reason:

::

   > Form now supports sorting as a global option that can be used by any implementation; previously fluidcontent added its own but can now delegate this to Flux. This means that from now on you should define options="{sorting: 10}" instead of wrapping the sorting value in a scope like {Fluidcontent: {sorting: 10}}.

Solution:

::

   > Hotfix: Comment out line 277 in luidTYPO3\Fluidcontent\Service\ConfigurationService in EXT:fluidcontent 4.4.1 (https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/fluidcontent/issues/376) (not so cool)
   > Regular fix: Use development branch of EXT:flux (https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/pull/1283)
