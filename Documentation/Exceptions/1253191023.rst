Case 1 - Missing entry in Fluid Styled Content
----------------------------------------------

Using `fluid_styled_content`: had to add a list entry for my current plugin.
`fluid_styled_content` needs you to override its default *if you change
the templateRootPaths*.
Meaning that when overriding lib.fluidContent, you need to add
something like this:

::

   lib.fluidContent {
       templateName = YourTemplateName
       templateRootPaths {
           30 = EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Templates
       }
       layoutRootPaths {
           30 = EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Layouts
       }
       partialRootPaths {
           30 = EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Partials
       }
       list {
           templateName = YourListTemplateName
       }
   }


Case 2 - Not activated extension
---------------------------------

::

   TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\Exception
   TypoScript object path "tt_content.list.your_extension." does not exist

This means that you have formerly activated an extension. Then you have inserted a frontend plugin. 
But at a later time you have deactivated this extension. You must either hide this plugin or activate the extension again.
