TYPO3 Exception 1596980032
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

**Errormessage:**

::

       #1596980032 InvalidArgumentException
       A cache identifier was not set.

When debugged the corresponding cache.definition might look like this:

::

       '' => array('groups' => array('pages', 'all'))

This error is able to drive the complete frontend and backend unusable.

| 
| **The reason**

Before TYPO3 version 10 it was common that the variable $_EXTKEY was
replaced automatically by the extension-key of the corresponding
extension.

This has changed and the variable either has to be defined or any cases
directly replaced with the extension-key.

As the variable was undefined in the case where this error was remarked,
the array-key for the cache-definition just was empty.

So in this case it was an incomplete extension-update.

| 
| **How to fix**

Search in all extensions for usage of $_EXTKEY in the file
ext_localconf.php.

If the variable is used but not defined in that file, define it in the
beginning or replace it by the extension-key.
