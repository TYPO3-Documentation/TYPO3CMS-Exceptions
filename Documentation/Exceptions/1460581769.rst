   [TYPO3 version] - [Date of solution]
   ====================================

   Situation

   Describe everything to understand the situation: Systems, environment, versions.
   What happened?

   Solution
   --------

   1. Did you find a solution?
   2. Explain what you did ..


TYPO3 10.4.21 - October 6, 2021
===============================

Situation
---------

* Exception in FE on loading page: Oops, an error occurred! LinkHandler for page=uid=p1004 was not registered
* Exception in redirects module when filtering for the redirect where this problem occurs (e.g. enter the source URL)

The exception is logged, you can find the exception stack trace in the TYPO3 log.

Cause of problem
----------------

* An invalid link target was entered in a redirect, e.g. target=`t3://page=uid=p1004`


Solution
--------

1. This can be fixed by entering a correct target in the redirect.
2. Because of the exception, it can't be done in the redirects module, must be done in the
   database directly, e.g.

.. code-block:: sql

   UPDATE sys_redirect SET target='t3://page?uid=1004' WHERE target='t3://page=uid=p1004';
