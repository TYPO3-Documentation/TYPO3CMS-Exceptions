Wrong sys_file_reference PID of related records
===============================================

A file reference used in record which had a pid to a non existing page.
In my example we have migrated tx_news images to FAL and some
sys_file_reference entries have been created. No sure why, but we ended
up wrong pid values for our created sys_file_reference entry. This can
be fixed by adjusting sys_file_reference pid value to sysfolder uid of
related news record with an SQL statement.

Record with uid 15 from table tx_powermail_domain_model_form not found
======================================================================

Powermail error after deleting items from database. This can be fixed by
inserting the specific item into the database
