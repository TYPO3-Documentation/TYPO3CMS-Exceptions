TYPO3 Exception 1472074485
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Unknown column 'tx_myext_domain_model_myfield.' in 'order clause'
=================================================================

There's no 'foreign_sorting' set in TCA. For me it happened with an
Inline type.

Table 'my_db.tx_myext_domain_model_myfield' doesn't exist
=========================================================

When you have mapped a relation to an external model in your extension,
but forgot to define the mapping in :file:`EXT:extension/Configuration/Extbase/Persistence/Classes.php`.

Table 'my_db.tx_myext_domain_model_mymodel' doesn't exist
=========================================================

When you use other extension names in your extension which do not correspond the Extbase table naming scheme,
but forgot to define the :php:`tableName` name in :file:`EXT:extension/Configuration/Extbase/Persistence/Classes.php`.

Table 'my_db.tx_myext_persistence_objectstorage' doesn't exist
==============================================================

Solution
--------

Go to :guilabel:`Admin tools -> Maintenance -> Database compare` and bring the
database schema up to date.
