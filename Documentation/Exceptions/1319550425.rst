TYPO3 Exception 1319550425
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Origin: Editor may create/edit/delete records of a custom extension. The
records may store images in a folder in fileadmin. The Editor is not
allowd to see the folder, but only to edit records. The Editor now tries
to remove a file from a record. TYPO3 then tries to delete this file.
This will raise an execption since the user is not allowed to delete the
file. > You are not allowed to delete the file
"/user_upload/customfolder/foo.png"

Problem: FAL checks for sufficent user rights. The user is not allowed
to see the folder in fileadmin and therefore has no rights to delete
files in the given folder.

Solution:

-  Easy: Just add a Filemount for this folder and give it to the
   user/usergroup. This however means that the user may see \*all\*
   files in the folde, not only his own.
-  Better:Â ???
