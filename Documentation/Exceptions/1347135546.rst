The error always occurs. Even when I wanted to clear the cache in the
Install Tool The reason was a wrong defined TCA-column. I wrote
something like this:

::

   'items' => array(
      'items' => array(
          array('noRotation', 0),
          array('oneQuarter', 1),
          array('halfCircle', 2),
          array('threeQuarter', 3),
     ),
   ),
