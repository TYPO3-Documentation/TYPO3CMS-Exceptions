TYPO3 Exception 1439555561
==========================

A composer.json file has a syntax error. Use the command line
*composer.phar validate* to get details about this error and the line
number which causes this error.

This error can also occur if the composer.json file is not accessible.

**Solution:**

Use a JSON online validator and copy-paste the contents of your
composer.json. Then you will see the exact syntax error in this JSON
file. E.g. `here <https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/>`__.
