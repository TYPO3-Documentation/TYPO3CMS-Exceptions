TYPO3 Exception 1588095936
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Error occurs after importing database dump and open the backend the
first time. No login, normally automatically logged in by a service.
Maybe old temporary files or other old data. Clear InstallTool Cache
solve the problem.

The error might also occur due to a very strict referrer-policy of your webserver. For instance, if you set it to 'Header set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin"' in your Apache server, you will see this page after trying to login to the backend.
