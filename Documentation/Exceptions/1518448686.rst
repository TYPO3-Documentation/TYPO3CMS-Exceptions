TYPO3 Exception 1518448686

Error message
=============

The following exception may be displayed since TYPO3 v9 during login:

::

      #1518448686 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Exception
      No suitable request handler found.

Reasons
=======

Password for installation tool is missing in ``LocalConfiguration.php``.
TYPO3 tries to find out the encryption type by analyzing the password in
order to allow logins after migrating to an other encrypting algorithm.

Solutions
=========

-  Open ``typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php``
-  Check if ``$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['installToolPassword']``
   is set
-  Enter a dummy hash (e.g.
   ``'$2y$12$AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'``)
   to be able to generate a new hash value.
