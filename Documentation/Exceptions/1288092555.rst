I have a problem with several TYPO3 installations.

In version 6.2.6 typo3_src everything worksfinde. But in version
typo3_src-6.2.7 I get the error:

Oops, an error occurred!

Could not load file layout. Tried Following paths: "... / typo3conf /
ext / SOME NAME / Resources / Private / Templates / Layouts /
Body.html", "... typo3conf / ext / SOME NAME / Resources / Private /
Templates / Layouts / Body".

SOLUTION: in typo3conf/ext/SOME NAME/Resources/Private/Templates/Layouts
the file names has to with a large initial letter.
