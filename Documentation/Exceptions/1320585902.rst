If the message is:

"#1320585902: $hookObject must implement interface
TYPO3\CMS\Core\Database\TableConfigurationPostProcessingHookInterface
(More information)"

when trying to install **dam_falmigration**, the problem is because you
just clone the repository and the name of the extension folder is
"**t3ext-dam_falmigration**" and not "**dam_falmigration**" as it should
be. Just rename the folder to fix the issue.

marked as resolved though.
