TYPO3 Exception 1320585902

If the message is:

"#1320585902: $hookObject must implement interface
TYPO3\CMS\Core\Database\TableConfigurationPostProcessingHookInterface
(More information)"

when trying to install **dam_falmigration**, the problem is because you
just clone the repository and the name of the extension folder is
"**t3ext-dam_falmigration**" and not "**dam_falmigration**" as it should
be. Just rename the folder to fix the issue.

Related bug reports are `67933: TYPO3 Core - compatibility6 crashes
TYPO3 BE [Closed] <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/67933>`__ and `68480:
TYPO3 Core - compatibility6 crashes TYPO3 BE - part 2 [Closed; assigned
to Helmut Hummel] <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/68480>`__. Both are
marked as resolved though.
