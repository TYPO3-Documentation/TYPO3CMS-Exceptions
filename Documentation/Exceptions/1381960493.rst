| I got this Exception with a huge amount of Dependency Loops. I fixed
  the problem with commenting all custom extensions in
  LocalConfiguration.php -> extListArray and then re-enable each
  extension step by step.
| EDIT: The solution above was only a temporary one. The Problem was two
  Extensions which rely on each other. Sadly all extensions are shown in
  the exception-message.
