TYPO3 Exception 1232986877

For me this happend after I configured TYPO3 6.2 to use the APC Backend
for Extbase Cache and afterwards disabled the APC Cache module on the
server. Solution is to reenable the APC or delete the cache
configuration from LocalConfiguration.php. Don't forget to clear the
typo3temp/Cache afterwards.

This error will also occur if your apc cache runs out of memory - either
give it more or as a quick temp fix clear out the cache with a minimal
script like <?php apc_clear_cache();Â ?>
