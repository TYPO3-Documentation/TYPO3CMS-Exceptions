TYPO3 Exception 1253036401
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


I receive this when the extensions fluid_styled_content and
css_styled_content are installed and are activated in the page template.
It doesn't seems not to be a genereal error, but one that is connected
with on of our custom-made extensions. Up to now I have no clue, where
exactly the error comes from.

|
| This error ( argument "*path*" was already defined and should not be
  defined again ) is caused by an extension viewhelper registering it
  arguments differently after an upgrade. Clear the cache from install
  tool solves it.

================================================
================================================

This error occurred, after upgrading from TYPO3 CMS 7 to 8 having a
custom view helper extending
\`TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\ViewHelpers\ImageViewHelper`. The registering of
arguments changed from CMS 7 to. In 7 most of the arguments where
defined in the signature of the \`render()\` method. That changed in CMS
8. In my view helper the arguments were still in the signature causing
this error.
