TYPO3 10.4 - 2023-01-26
==================================

The Issue
---------
-  "Hash has to be non-empty string."
-  Entries in 'sys_file' table point to non-existing files on the server

Solution
---------
-   Ensure that the files contained in your :file:`fileadmin/` tree are consistent with your :sql:`sys_file` database relations.

    You may either be missing referenced files in :file:`fileadmin/`, or :sql:`sys_file` lists outdated entries.
    
    The CLI command `typo3 cleanup:missingfiles` may help synchronizing your database to the current 
:file:`fileadmin/` structure.
