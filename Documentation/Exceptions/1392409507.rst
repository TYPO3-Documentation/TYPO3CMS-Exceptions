TYPO3 Exception 1392409507
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Invalid form/module token detected. Access Denied.
==================================================

The problem is usually caused by an missing security token which
protects against
`CSRF <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29>`__.
It can occur in the backend by clicking on an icon, link or using other
controls. This problem is usually only backend related but could also
occur in the frontend when using frontend editing.

**For TYPO3 integrators:**

If you encounter this problem with default backend modules included in
the TYPO3 distribution you should first check if there is already an
error report on https://forge.typo3.org and if this is not the case feel
free to create a new bug report.

**For developers:**

See https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ApiOverview/FormProtection/Index.html
