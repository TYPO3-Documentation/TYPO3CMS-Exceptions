TYPO3 Exception 1392409507
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


The problem is usually caused by an missing security token which
protects againg
`CSRF <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29>`__.
It can occur in the backend by clicking on an icon, link or using other
controls. This problem is usually only backend related but could also
occur in the frontend when using frontend editing.

**For TYPO3 integrators:**

If you encounter this problem with default backend modules included in
the TYPO3 distribution you should first check if there is already an
error report on https://forge.typo3.org [not available anymore] and if
this is not the case feel free to create a new bug report.

**For developers:**

In custom backend modules it is usually necessary to generate links to
the module using BackendUtility::getModuleUrl() method
(https://typo3.org/api/typo3cms/class_t_y_p_o3_1_1_c_m_s_1_1_backend_1_1_utility_1_1_backend_utility.html#a8437ed5134d2c407ca67cc5f5627b280

"script" key for type=>script wizards is deprecated. Instead the
configuration option "module" should get used

| **Extension ics_awstats & TYPO3 6.2:**

ics_awstats may need a little updating: moduleToken / security token
must be forwarded to awstats (for link generation). In mod1/index.php
near line 100 locate variable $aws_wrapper, and add moduleToken like
this: $aws_wrapper .= '&moduleToken='.t3lib_div::_GP('moduleToken');
