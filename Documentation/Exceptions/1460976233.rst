TYPO3 Exception 1460976233
==========================

In a custom content element, that wont check, if an image is there or
not - will put this exception out. Check, if your CE is capable, to
handle if there is an image or not.

The extension Camaliga is sensible for this issue. If you have assigned
a Gallery Map Element to a plugin and with this element is no image
connected, than you receive this error message. Look in your storage
folder with the Gallery Elements and check all Elements if they have an
image assigned. Check also all the translated elements in this folder.
