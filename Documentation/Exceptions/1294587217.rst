TYPO3 Exception 1294587217
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The page is not configured! [type=x][].
=======================================

No PAGE object defined for type=x
---------------------------------
This happens if you forget the line

::

   page = PAGE

(for `typeNum` = x from the error message, with `0` being the default)

in the Setup field of your TypoScript record.

When you see this error, a TypoScript template is already there. In the
backend go to the page with that TypoScript template. Most probably it
is on the root page of your website; that is the one directly below the
very first page, below the one with the TYPO3 logo next to it. Use the
"Template" module to have a look at the template located at that page.

Use the Template module to modify that template: Select the
"Info/Modify" screen from the drop-down box at the top. Then click on
the pencil icon next to the word "Setup" and replace what you have in
the Setup field with the following lines:

.. container::

   ::

          # Default PAGE object:
          page = PAGE
          # Define output for typeNum=0, the default type.
          page.typeNum = 0
          page.10 = TEXT
          page.10.value = HELLO WORLD!

Save the template and open the page in the frontend. You should see the
words "HELLO WORLD!".

Another possibility is that you are trying to access a page with an
undefined page type. E.g. :samp:`https://example.org/?type=123`, but you do not
have a ``(page).typeNum = 123`` defined in your TypoScript template.

Using broken TypoScript
------------------------

.. code-block:: typoscript

   #. Default PAGE object:
   page = PAGE page. 10 = TEXT page. 10.value = HELLO WORLD!

Removing the spaces and adding line breaks leads to a page running fine without the error.

Using Bootstrap_package
-----------------------

You forgot to include the bootstrap_package static template.
