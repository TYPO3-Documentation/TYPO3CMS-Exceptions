Error Message:

::

      #1338996122: Package "typo3-realurl" is already registered.

Solution 1:

This happens after I accidently installed a backup version of an
extension: realurl.2.1.7. Then it does not help to set this extension
inactive in the file typo3conf/PackageStates.php. You must remove the
whole configuration part for this extension from
typo3conf/PackageStates.php:

::

          'realurl.2.1.7' => [
              'composerName' => 'dmitryd/typo3-realurl',
              'state' => 'inactive',
              'packagePath' => 'typo3conf/ext/realurl.2.1.7/',
              'suggestions' => [],
          ],

Solution 2:

Another package uses the same name in its »composer.json« file. Even if
»composer mode« is not enabled and the composer file is just copied, it
will cause the TYPO3 Package Manager to throw the correct exception.
This may happen if you copy an extension, e.g. from
»typo3conf/ext/acme« to »typo3conf/ext/acme.old«. Just search the
filesystem for any other instances of the same package name and rename
one of them. Attention: Composer files allow aliases for package names
in the »replace« section, catch them as well.
