==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


Exception is caused when a site uses Solr

Workspaces
==========

The origin of this Exception is
`class.tx_solr_site.php <https://git.typo3.org/TYPO3CMS/Extensions/solr.git/blob/HEAD:/classes/class.tx_solr_site.php>`__
[not available anymore]

A statement concerning workspaces and solr can be found
`here <http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-project-solr/2011-October/000670.html>`__
- solr currently doesn't support workspaces.

Old IndexQueue Items
====================

Check the table *tx_solr_indexqueue_item*, there may be some records
with a *root* that is currently not configured. This may happen when
changing site root without clearing the old records.
