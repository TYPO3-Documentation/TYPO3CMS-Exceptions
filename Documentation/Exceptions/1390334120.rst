TYPO3 Exception 1390334120
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

I'm getting this error frequently when installing and uninstalling
extensions, running the DBAL etc, in TYPO3 6.2.6. It seems to have
started when I (unsuccessfully) installed the extension 'uncache'. Also,
one of the very few references to this exception is linked to uncache:
https://forum.typo3.org/index.php/t/206055/

UPDATE: I cleared all caches, and uninstalled uncache previously, but
the error kept popping up. Then I deleted uncache, and truncated the
cache\_ and cf_tables manually. Looks better now, I hope.
