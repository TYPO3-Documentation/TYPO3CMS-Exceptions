| **I was led to this page after an SQL executing error from install
  tool. The proposed database modifications all failed because all sql
  table notations were missing the database name as prefix. The
  workaround was to enter the sql, adding the db name, into MySQL
  workbench and executed the failed sql commands one by one.**
