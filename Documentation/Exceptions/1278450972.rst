#1278450972: The classname "TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\ObjectStorage<\Webconsulting\WebconWarndienst\Domain\Model\Location>" was not found and thus can not be reflected.
============================================================================================================================================================================

This (extbase) error can occur if you have annotated a (controller
action) method using "@param" but have not given a type hint. If the
annotation is wrong this error will occur.

Example:

::

    /**
     * A test action
     *
     * @param \MyVendor\MyExtension\Domain\Motel\InvalidName $myVariable
     */
    public function testAction($myVariable) {

As you see the @param annotation is wrong. Because you usually have not
any "Domain\Motel" namespace and there is no type hint for $myVariable
in the function header.

So either correct the annotation, clear all caches:

::

    /**
     * A test action
     *
     * @param \MyVendor\MyExtension\Domain\Model\ValidName $myVariable
     */
    public function testAction($myVariable) {

Or try to add a type hint:

::

    /**
     * A test action
     *
     * @param \MyVendor\MyExtension\Domain\Model\ValidName $myVariable
     */
    public function testAction(\MyVendor\MyExtension\Domain\Model\ValidName $myVariable) {

I had a Composer based Installation. And i have to add my ext. to the
psr4 autoload in copmposer.json:

::

     
      "autoload": {
           "psr-4": {
                   "MyVendor\\MyExtension\\":"web/typo3conf/ext/MyExtension/Classes"
           }
       },

#1278450972 TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Reflection\Exception\UnknownClassException
========================================================================

**Class Boolean does not exist. Reflection failed.**

::

      at TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Reflection\ReflectionService->buildClassSchema('Vendorname\\Extensionname\\Domain\\Model\\MyModel')

Got this error because in MyModel was a setter with a wrong typehint, in
my case it was something like

::

      public function setFreeShipping(\Boolean $freeShipping) 

Solution was to change *\\Boolean* to *bool*.
