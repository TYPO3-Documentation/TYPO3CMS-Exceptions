#1250715544: Task is past end date
==================================

OutOfBoundsException thrown in file
typo3/sysext/scheduler/Classes/Execution.php.

This happens if you try to forcly execute a task that has the endtime
set before now. Make sure that the endtime is set properly before
running a task.

It might also happen if you try to save a "single" task with the an
enddate set, e.g. if you convert a recurring task to a single task.
