This exception can also simply be thrown when you use a fluid template
with an image tag <f:image src="image.jpg"> and the image does not
exist! So check your templates for correct image sources before checking
modelsÂ !

I had this for the extension ws_flexslider. I had updated it during the
upgrade from 6.1 to 6.2, but forgot about the partials and templates
directory that I had moved to a separate place, in my contants.ts:

::

   plugin.tx_wsflexslider.view.partialRootPath = fileadmin/tpl/ext/ws_flexslider/Partials/
   plugin.tx_wsflexslider.view.templateRootPath = fileadmintpl/ext/ws_flexslider/Templates/
