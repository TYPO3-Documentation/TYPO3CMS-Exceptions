RuntimeException: Error handler could not fetch error page
==========================================================

::
   RuntimeException: Error handler could not fetch error page(due to
   no internet connection or protected)

Migrating from Fluidpages to Flux
=================================

If this exception appears while migrating from Fluidpages to Flux,
verify that the corresponding Flux-TS is included.

404 error handler set to "Display content from page" (TYPO3 9.x)
================================================================

::

    (1/1) #1544172838 Error handler could not fetch error pageuntimeException
    Error handler could not fetch error page
    "https://project.localdomain.vm/http-error-404",
    reason: cURL error 51: SSL: no alternative certificate subject name
    matches target host name 'project.localdomain.vm' (see
    https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html)

When you have set your 404-error-handler to "Display content from page"
on a development domain, cURL can't call the target page when the
certificate isn't valid.

Solution: test again without SSL or test on a staging system with a
properly installed valid certificate.


Self signed certificate problem
===============================

::

    (1/1) #1544172838 RuntimeException  Error handler could not fetch
    error page "https://example.de/startseite", reason: cURL error 60:
    SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate (see
    https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html)
