TYPO3 Exception 1329821485
==========================

This exception can occour due to at least three reasons:

-  Bug #51747 (https://forge.typo3.org/issues/51747) in typo3 6.1.4 as
   was the case on http://www.physikbuch.de
-  a folder in typo3temp or fileadmin that actually is write-protected
-  The folder isn't write-protected but completely missing.

Possible missing folders are

-  typo3temp/_processed\_
-  typo3temp/_migrated\_
-  fileadmin/_processed\_
-  fileadmin/_migrated\_

Known issue, see `43484: TYPO3 Core - Extension Manager only shows error
message "File has been deleted." [Closed; assigned to Georg
Ringer] <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/43484>`__

-  Some unknown cached php file has been active. I have provided the PHP
   file "clear_cache_franz.php" at
   http://www.jambage.com/uploads/media/clear_cache_franz.php.zip [not
   available anymore] to clear all caches. Use the Install Tool to clear
   all files in the folders typo3temp/_processed\_ and
   typo3temp/_migrated_.
