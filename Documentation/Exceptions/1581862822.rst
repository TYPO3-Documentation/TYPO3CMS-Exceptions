TYPO3 Exception 1581862822

Maybe your content is insert into a Fluid template by <f:cObject
typoscriptObjectPath /> and your TypoScript lib uses a insertData = 1,
this could be the reason why the form submit fails:

insertData behaves like dataWrap and parses curly braces, see
https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Functions/Stdwrap.html?highlight=insertdata

So, the serialized value of the hidden form field
tx_form_formframework[__trustedProperties] get's parsed, too. The
following HMAC validation throws the exception, because the
\__trustedProperties is broken.
