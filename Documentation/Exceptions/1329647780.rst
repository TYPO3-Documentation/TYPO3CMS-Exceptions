Error: Object with identifier
"1:/user_upload/bilder/Arbeiten_in_Architektur/Augsburg/" does not exist
in storage

posible cause: under fileadmin I renamed the folder
"Arbeiten_in_Architektur" in to "Architektur"

Error Trigered when I tried to add an image under Content Element "Add
Image" (pop-up Windows open and tries to finds the folder
"Arbeiten_in_Architektur" which was renamed and therefore doesn't exist
anymore.)

Solution: Logout and Login-again.
