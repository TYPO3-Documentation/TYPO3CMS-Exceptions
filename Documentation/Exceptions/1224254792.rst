TYPO3 Exception 1224254792
==========================

Namespace could not be resolved. This exception should never be thrown!
=======================================================================

-  Most likely, you're using a ViewHelper or something that has its own
   namespace, but you didn't declared that namespace (e.g: missing
   ``{namespace myNamespace=Tx_MyExt_ViewHelpers}`` or with PHP
   namespaces: ``{namespace myNamespace=Vendor\MyExt\ViewHelpers}``).

-  The quite common instance is using a VHS View Helper
   (e.g.\ ``v:extension.path.resources``) without referencing the VHS
   namespace (``{namespace v=Tx_Vhs_ViewHelpers}``).

-  Also keep in mind that may be required to declare namespace(s) in the
   partial(s) even thought they where declared in the parent template.
