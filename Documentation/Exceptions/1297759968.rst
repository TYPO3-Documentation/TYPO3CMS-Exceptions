TYPO3 Exception 1297759968

Exception while property mapping at property path "":Object with identity "1" not found.
========================================================================================

This error is thrown when a link to a hidden record is called.

Exception while property mapping at property path "":Method::__construct() does not exist
==========================================================================================

The ReflectionService tries to get the constructor arguments of your
model class, which in this case seem not to exist.

As a work around you can put an empty :php:`__construct` method in your model
class

::

    /**
     *
     */
    public function __construct() {
    }

Exception while property mapping at property path "":Could not find a suitable type converter for "array|null" because no such class or interface exists
========================================================================================================================================================

See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/48172

Try updating the relevant extensions and TYPO3. If everything is up-to-date and the
error still occurs setting the TypoScript option `plugin.tx_news.features.rewrittenPropertyMapper = 0` may help.

.. hint::

   Enabling/disabling the `rewrittenPropertyMapper` has huge
   impacts on extbase behaviour. You are strongly advised to learn about
   the "new" propertyMapper and how to use/configure it rather then
   deactivating it.

Exception while property mapping at property path "": Could not find a suitable type converter for "..." because no such class or interface exists.
===================================================================================================================================================

After adding an new model and clearing the caches (BE -> :guilabel:`Flush system caches`, :bash:`rm -rf typo3temp/Cache/`), the new class still was not found.
Deactivating and reactivating the extension was solution.

Background: the autoload information (:file:`typo3temp/autoload/`) wasn't
flushed/updated. Since TYPO3 v8 there's a option in the install-tool for
regenerating the autoconfiguration files.

Exception while property mapping at property path "...": Could not determine the child object type.
====================================================================================================

Try clearing all caches.

Try to truncate the :sql:`cf_extbase_reflection` table after you modified the
model.

Exception while property mapping at property path "Property 0" was not found in target object of type "..."
===========================================================================================================

When using extended models you need to set the base class variables to
protected instead of private.

Another solution could be to truncate the "cf_extbase_reflection" table

This error is also displayed if a property in a fluid-form is wrong. In
my case I had property="{object.propertyName}" instead of
property="propertyName"

Exception while property mapping at property path "...":No converter found which can be used to convert from "array" to "string".
=================================================================================================================================

The solution is there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16405963/typo3-how-to-use-file-upload-with-extbase

Exception while property mapping at property path "It is not allowed to map property "badproperty". ..."
========================================================================================================

-  Possible Cause: For me the reason was a <form> inside a <form>. Seems like the __trustedProperies in the second form made my first form to fail.
-  See also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18654920/extbase-exception-while-property-mapping-at-property-path

If `badProperty` is an ObjectStorage that holds references to other
models and you want to edit this relation in a Fluid form with a
multiselect or checkboxes, don't let Fluid convert your objects. So
instead of doing this:

::

    <f:form.checkbox property="yourProperty" value="{someObject}" />

assign only the uid integers to the viewhelper, like this:

::

    <f:form.checkbox property="yourProperty" value="{someObject.uid}" />

Exception while property mapping at property path "":The target type was no string, but of type "NULL"
======================================================================================================

See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66049

This issue concerning passing an array of objects to a controller action
should have been resolved in 7.x because the old property mapper has
been removed completely.

Exception while property mapping at property path "": Path does not exist in array
==================================================================================

When resetting options in YAML config files for EXT:form write

::

    formEditor:
      editors:
        700: null

instead of

::

    formEditor:
      editors:
        700:
          identifier: null
          templateName: null
          
          
Exception while property mapping at property path "propertyname": The identity property "" is no UID.   
=====================================================================================================

TYPO3 expects a relation as a property and can't find it. Check if a related database record exists (here: at "propertyname") and make sure to catch the error if no relation is present. 

This can also happen if an extbase form has an object with a file upload element (and involved TypeConverters): If a bot maliciously spams your form, it might submit a POST/GET request with that type=file upload element, but uses type=text instead. This will lead into a structure, where the property will not contain the expected array data (tmp_name, name, errors, size, ... from $_FILES), and lead to this exception. In this case the error would say `The Identity property "a2vsd3fs" is no UID`, where `a2vsd3fs` is the actual random spam string submitted by the bot, even though it reads like a TYPO3 internal UID placeholder.

You can silence that error by using an initializeAction and checking if the mentioned properties actually are submitted as an array, or only as a string. But in fact, this exception would not be "wrong", because the actual bot request was faulty. But we wanted this recurring error not to flood our sys_log entries.

(TODO: This might also be fixable with better property mapping configuration and/or TypeConverter checks catching this error; the UploadedFileReferenceTypeConverter from Helmut Hummel was used in this case, which provoked the error above)

Exception while property mapping at property path "filter": No delimiter configured for TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Property\TypeConverter\ArrayConverter and non-empty value given.
==========================================================================================================================================================================

This could happen if your Fluid ViewHelper for a checkbox is like this and filter is an array:

::

    <f:form action="myAction" objectName="MyDto" object="MyDto">
        <f:form.checkbox property="filter" value="TYPO3" />
    </f:form>

You have to add multiple="1" in the Fluid ViewHelper:

::

    <f:form action="myAction" objectName="MyDto" object="MyDto">
        <f:form.checkbox property="filter" value="TYPO3" multiple="1" />
    </f:form>
