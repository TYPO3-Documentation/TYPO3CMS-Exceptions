TYPO3 Exception 1365429673
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Extension key "..." is NOT loaded!
==================================

Disable the extension manually
------------------------------

Open :file:`typo3conf/PackageStates.php`, look up the extension key and
change

.. code-block:: none

   [
      // ...
      'state' => 'active'
      // ...
   ]

to


.. code-block:: none

   [
      // ...
      'state' => 'inactive'
      // ...
   ]


You might also need to clear the PHP code cache in :file:`typo3temp`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rm -rf typo3temp/*

Observations
============

Using a Vagrant with TYPO3 6.2beta6 we had this problem

`vagrant reload --provision` did not help.

Frontend is working fine but you can't login to the backend!

My solution: You can check in the TYPO3 Database Table :sql:`sys_log` which
exception is thrown. Now find the offending extension in
`LocalConfiguration.php` and disable it (see above).

Mixed composer/classic installation
-----------------------------------

This could also happen when you attempt to unpack a .tar.gz packed
version of TYPO3 and run it's installer over an previously
composer-style-installed instance. The install-tool then breaks the
:file:`PackageStates.php`, trying to recover the old version did help in my
case. For me the extension cms was affected. This happens during an
update from TYPO3 6.2 to 7.1 or later. You must search for the following
array part or add it to your file :file:`PackageStates.php`:

::

      'cms' =>
      array (
        'manifestPath' => ,
        'composerName' => 'typo3/cms',
        'state' => 'active',
        'packagePath' => 'typo3/sysext/cms/',
        'classesPath' => 'Classes/',
        'suggestions' =>
        array (
        ),
      ),

back from TYPO3 7.6.x
---------------------

The following error message is shown when you downgrade from TYPO3 7.6
to 6.2.

::

      TYPO3 Fatal Error: Extension key "cms" is NOT loaded

You must have a backup copy of the file typo3conf/PackageStates.php .
Restore a file PackageStates.php which is compatible under TYPO3 6.2.
