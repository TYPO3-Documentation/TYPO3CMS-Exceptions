TYPO3 Exception 1249479819
==========================

Persistence
===========

You need to make sure that your object is already persisted before
calling Repository->update($o); Add it first with Repository->add($o);

Usage of (new) property mapper / t3extblog
==========================================

I encountered this exception when trying to install/use t3extblog with
TYPO3 6.2.10. Check your code for correct usage of (new) property
mapper, this should give you a hint (taken from
https://forge.typo3.org/issues/51330):

old property mapper is not supported anymore and removed from the Core
after 6.2. Use the new one instead.

For those who do not know how to fix it, I will show how I have fixed
it.

| Old code:
| $persistenceManager =
  \\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance('Tx_Extbase_Persistence_Manager');

| New code:
| $objectManager =
  \\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance(\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Object\ObjectManager::class);
| $persistenceManager =
  $objectManager->get(\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Generic\PersistenceManager::class);

Object retrieved by property mapper can't get updated via persistence manager
=============================================================================

If you try to ->update() an object which has been retrieved from the
property mapper by mapping GET/POST parameters, so if you pass the
object as argument of your controller action, this issue may occur.

For me the solution was to re-retrieve the object using the repository
and ->findByUid() method and then persist/update the retrieved object.
It seems the repository needs to "know" about the object.

::

      function yourAction(\Some\Model $item)
      {
          $updateItem = $this->itemRepository->findByUid($item->getUid());
          /**
           *  something with $updateItem ...
           */
          $this->itemRepository->update($updateItem);
      }
