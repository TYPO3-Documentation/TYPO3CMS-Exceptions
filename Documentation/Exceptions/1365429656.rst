TYPO3 Fatal Error: Extension key "..." is NOT loaded!
=====================================================

TYPO3 >= 10 LTS
---------------

Starting with TYPO3 10 LTS the variable `$_EXTKEY` isn't filled with the
extension key anymore. Solution: use the hardcoded extension key within
ext_tables.php and :file:`ext_localconf.php`.

See this page for further details:
`best-practices-for-ext-tables-php-and-ext-localconf-php <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ExtensionArchitecture/ConfigurationFiles/Index.html#best-practices-for-ext-tables-php-and-ext-localconf-php>`__

However, notice that $_EXTKEY `must be used in
ext_emconf.php <https://github.com/TYPO3/CmsComposerInstallers/pull/59>`__.

TYPO3 < 10 LTS
--------------

This error might come up, if you delete the files of a Extension from
the Extension Path (:file:`typo3conf/ext`), which is still activated in TYPO3.

**At first you should check, if there is a typo in the name of the
extension key.**

To solve this error, follow these steps:

*(Info: These steps will remove the installed extensions from the
"loaded Extension list" and TYPO3 cache.)*

1) remove the Extension from the loaded extension part in
:file:`typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php` - `[['EXT']['extConf']['*your_extension_key*']]`

2) remove either all files from :file:`typo3temp`-folder, or at least the files
in :file:`typo3temp/var/Cache/Code/cache_core` named :file:`ext_tables.php` and
:file:`ext_localconf.php`. In former versions of TYPO3 the folder name is
:file:`typo3temp/var/Cache/Code/cache_core`.

The error should be gone by now and the extension is removed. Reinstall
the extension if needed.

Additionally, this error might come up if you re-structure your TCA files to fit
into the new 6.2 structure. If you try to use `$_EXTKEY` in the
:file:`Configuration/TCA/tablename.php` files (for paths with
`extPath($_EXTKEY)`), then `$_EXTKEY` will be empty and thus TYPO3 looks for
the extension ' '. Solution is to replace `$_EXTKEY` by the extension key of the
extension.

If you encounter this error during an upgrade to 6.2, you might check
your :file:`LocalConfiguration.php` for the right order of extensions in the
deprecated `extListArray`. (e.g. `EXT:formhandler` has to be included
before `EXT:formhandler_subscription`.)
