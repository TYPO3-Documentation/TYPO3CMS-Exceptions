TYPO3 Exception 1334756737

A cache file could not be written.

-  Check your quota.
-  Check if filesystem is full.

Troubleshooting: Log on to the console or ftp as the user that runs php
and try to create the file. Add some text to the file so it has more
than 0 bytes.

I had this problem with an installation today. The solution was to grant
owner rights for the directorys: typo3conf, typo3temp, fileadmin and
uploads to PHP-User. Don't know if this ist spacial for my provider but
it seems to work at the moment.

The problem can also occur when there is not enough space on hard disk.
Try to expand the hard disk drive or delete some unnecessary files.
