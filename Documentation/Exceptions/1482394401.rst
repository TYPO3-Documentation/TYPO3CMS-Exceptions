TYPO3 Exception 1482394401

| **Missing "type" in TCA of field
  "['dummyTable']['dummyField']['config']**

| Enabling in the Form plugin the "Override finisher settings" option
  may display this error for misconfigured form finishers.
| Comment out one finisher at a time in the form definition file
  (*.form.yaml) to find the culprit.

| 
| **TCEforms flexform** The error message only gives an example table
  name and table field, because due to some migration to real names are
  not used in this error message. So you have to do some guesswork from
  which extension this error comes from. Check the flexform file
  flexform_ds.xml (or another name) of the TYPO3 extension if there are
  TCEforms entries. In the child pair config a type must have been
  defined.

Example:

::

    <config>
      <form_type>user</form_type>
      <userFunc><![CDATA[EXT:myextension/lib/class.tx_myextension_tceFunc.php:&tx_myextension_tceFunc->getCheckbox]]></userFunc>
      <checked>0</checked>
    </config>

You must use the type instead:

::

      <type>user</type>
