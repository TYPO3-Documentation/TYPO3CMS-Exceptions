Problem occurs when extension size is more than post_max_size (php.ini).
Just fix post_max_size and restart webserver.

TYPO3 Internals: Actually error should be reported at
\\TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Controller\UploadExtensionFileController::extractAction
in case of
$_FILES['tx_extensionmanager_tools_extensionmanagerextensionmanager'] is
null.
