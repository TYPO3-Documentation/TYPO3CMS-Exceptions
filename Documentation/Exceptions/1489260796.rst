    Uncaught TYPO3 Exception
    #1489260796: TYPO3.CMS.Form.prototypes.standard does not exist within the configuration

This happens when you created a form based on the TYPO3 standard form
and call it on a page in the frontend, but you forgot to include the
extension template in TypoScript settings.
