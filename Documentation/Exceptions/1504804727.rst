   [10.4] - [9th April 2021]
   ====================================

   Situation
   ---------

The TYPO3 backend throws an exception, when I click on Extensions.
(1/1) #1504804727 RuntimeException

This module "tools_ExtensionmanagerExtensionmanager" is only available as system maintainer
in /foo/bar/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Authentication/BackendUserAuthentication.php line 464

   Solution
   --------

This currently logged in backend user has been removed from the System Maintainers. 
You must ask from all backend users who is a System Maintainer. He can put you back.
