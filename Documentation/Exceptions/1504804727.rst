[10.4] - [9th April 2021]
=========================

Situation
---------

The TYPO3 backend throws an exception, when I click on Extensions.

.. code-block:: none

   (1/1) #1504804727 RuntimeException

   This module "tools_ExtensionmanagerExtensionmanager" is only available as system maintainer
   in /foo/bar/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Authentication/BackendUserAuthentication.php line 464

Solution
--------

The currently logged in backend user has been removed from the system maintainers list.
Ask for access to be granted again by a backend user who is a system maintainer. Any system maintainer may grant access to other users.
