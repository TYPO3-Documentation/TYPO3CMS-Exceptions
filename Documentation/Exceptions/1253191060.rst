**Exception 1253191060**

> Could not get image resource for
"/var/www/path-to-nonexisting-file/vhs-pdf-dummy.pdf-page1.png".

A ViewHelper tries to load an non-existing image.

The exception is thrown in VHS package
(vhs/Classes/ViewHelpers/Media/Image/AbstractImageViewHelper.php &
vhs/Classes/ViewHelpers/Resource/AbstractImageViewHelper.php)

Try the find the Content Element with the missing file and replace it.

Edit: Sometimes a ViewHelper tries to generate an image and pass it to
the image ViewHelper. In my case the
»vhs/Classes/ViewHelpers/Media/PdfThumbnailViewHelper.php« Class tried
to generate a file in »'typo3temp/assets/vhs-pdf-' . $filename . '-page'
. $page . '.png'«. Due to false access right it was not able to save the
file, passed it to the Image ViewHelper which then raised the exception.

Note: The core ViewHelpers f:image and f:uri.image used to behave the
same. However they don't throw exceptions for missing images anymore.
