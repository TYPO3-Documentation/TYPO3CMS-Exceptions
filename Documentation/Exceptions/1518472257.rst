   [TYPO3 9.5.32] - 2022-01-07
   ====================================

   Situation
   ---------

   After upgrading a TYPO3 system from 8.7.41 it looks like the standard 404 page could not
   be fetched due to the lack of a site configuration. This only happens, when upgrading 
   a multi-domain-setup.

   Solution
   --------

   No site configuration after upgrading a multi-domain-setup - Add site configurations to all 
   possible templates and deactivate the "Domain" items in list module
