Error message:

::

   #1257246929: Tried resolving a template file for controller action "Page->render" in format ".html",
   but none of the paths contained the expected template file ().
   The following paths were checked: .../typo3conf/ext/fluidpages/Resources/Private/Templates/

Source:

::

   TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\View\Exception\InvalidTemplateResourceException thrown in file
   .../typo3_src/vendor/typo3fluid/fluid/src/View/TemplatePaths.php in line 590.

Problem: No page templates
==========================

We had this error when no fluidpage templates were available and thus
not selected in the backend.

Problem: Extension containing templates not installed
=====================================================

We had this error when site package extension which contained templates was not installed,
thus TYPO3 couldn't resolve EXT:extensionname/...  paths.

Problem: sitepackage not added in resources
===========================================

We had this error because the sitepackage was not added on root -> edit
page -> resources -> include pagetsconfig

Problem: TYPO3 9.5 Install Tool
===============================

This error happens after an upgrade from TYPO3 8.7. Then the TYPO3 9.5
Install Tool is stuck in this error message. All the caches must be
deleted. And the file index.php must be checked. This should be a link
and not a php file. Activate the `systemLogLevel' => 0`, `'devIPmask'` and
`'displayErrors' => 1` in the file :file:`LocalConfiguration.php`.
