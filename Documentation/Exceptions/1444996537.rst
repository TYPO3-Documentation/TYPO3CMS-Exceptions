TYPO3 Exception 1444996537
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


This error happens since TYPO3 7.6 if your extension has defined the TCA
in the file Configuration/TCA/my_extension_table.php and when
"'displayCond' => 'EXT:foreign_extension:LOADED:true'" is used.

see `Bug #76958: displayCond LOADED does not check the loaded
extension <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/76958>`__ [not available
anymore]

You must move the the column with the condition into the folder
Configuration/TCA/Overrides of your extension (my_extension) or of the
foreign extension (foreign_extension) or of a third connector extension
like my_extension_connector. There you must use condition

::

    if (\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::isLoaded('foreign_extension')) {
       $temporaryColumns = array (
         'my_field_for_foreign_extension' => array (

in the file Configuration/TCA/Overrides/my_extension_table.php around
the part where the column is defined.
