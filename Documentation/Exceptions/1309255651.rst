TYPO3 Exception 1309255651
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


The provided phpdoc annotation contains a type that is not recognized.

Allowed properties:

-  boolean
-  DateTime
-  string
-  integer

(This list is incomplete and should be extended, if that's desirable.
However I think it is helpful)

This can e.g. happen if you model contains properties of the type Date.

The extension_builder has a bug which allows to assign this faulty Type
to properties.

One solution is to manually edit the Model and replace all annotations
stating Date with DateTime.

Take care to for annotations in getters, setters and class-property
declarations.

See [ERROR: Cannot get content for issue "33875"] for similar problem
regarding "type".
