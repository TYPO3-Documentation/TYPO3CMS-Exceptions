TYPO3 Exception 1294587482
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt


This exception occurs when TYPO3 misses any mandatory PHP modules (i.e.
gd, mysql, openssl, fileinfo).

In TYPO3 4.6 and newer there is the module "openssl" also needed.

To fix this modify your php.ini file and activate the proper
extension(s) there.

Activating OpenSSL there will fix this error message. However, you
should also take care to configure it correctly, so that it is actually
working. Otherwise, you won't be able to use saltedpasswords, which is
recommended and enabled by default in TYPO3 4.6 and newer.
