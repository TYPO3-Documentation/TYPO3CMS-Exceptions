While updating from 6.2, the Extension Manager in 7.6 threw this error:

The extension "simulatestatic" has invalid version constraints in
conflicts section. Extension key is missing!

Changing package states or deactivating in LocalConfiguration.php did
nothing good. As the extensions in my case had to be replaced anyway, I
deleted their folders from typo3conf/ext/
